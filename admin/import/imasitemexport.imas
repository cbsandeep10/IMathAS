SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<h2>Introduction Assignment</h2>
<p>This is one of the only opportunities you have for extra credit. Please answer these questions so that I can get to know you.</p>
<p>Please be sure to push the "Submit" button when you are finished. If you only push "Save Answers", only <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you</strong></span></em> can see your answers and there is nothing for me to give credit for.</p>
<p>If you run into an Permission Denied/Access issue when trying to complete the survey for Question #12 in HW #1.1, I suspect that you have your browser configured for auto-logging into some account. That auto-logon is what is causing the error. (Please note that auto-logging in is not safe from a technological stand point.) The way around this is to open up a Private Browsing Window, log into iMathAS, and retry accessing the link in Question #12. You should be prompted in the resulting private browsing window to log into MyASU after clicking the link. Once you do, you should see the questions. (Auto-logging in is disabled in Private Browsing.)</p>

HW #3.4-Distribution Functions and Long-run Behavior, pt. 1
SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<h2>Distribution Functions and Long-run Behavior, part 1</h2>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">NOTE: You use must get at least 48 points on this assignment BEFORE HW #3.5 will become available to you.</span></strong></p>
<p>This homework assignment serves as an opportunity for you to continually work and wrestle with the ideas of probability, distributions, and distribution functions (a.k.a., cumulative density functions and cumulative probability functions), function notation, along with the other core ideas of Unit 3 (stochastic processes, stochastic variables, randomness, accumulation).</p>
<p>This assignment will ask you to read and think critically about several different distributions. Please make sure that you read all of the material presented.</p>
<p>There are three formats that you will use for answering questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Answer/Essay:</strong> used for answering questions about why, giving descriptions, or about giving interpretations.</li>
<ul>
<li>E.g.: Explain what <span class="AM" title="C_N(5|3,1)">`C_N(5|3,1)`</span> represents. (Answer: see next example.)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Function Notation:</strong> used for answering questions where I&rsquo;ve asked you to express/represent some value but do not required you to give a numeral.</li>
<ul>
<li>E.g.: Represent the the probability of getting a value of 5 or less when the stochastic variable follows a Normal distribution with an expected value of 3 and variance of 1 (Answer: see previous example. <span class="AM" title="C_N(5|3,1)">`C_N(5|3,1)`</span>)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> used for when I want you to give a numeric answer to a question. Some of these will be simple, but for the more complex problems you'll need to use the <a href="https://mathpost.asu.edu/~neil/statCalc/statcalc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stat Calculator</a>.</li>
<ul>
<li>E.g.: What is the probability that the stochastic variable discussed in the previous two examples will take on a value greater than 5? (Answer: using -1,000,000 as the lower limit and the Stat Calculator set to Normal, <span class="AM" title="1-C_N(5|3,1)=1-0.97724987=0.02275013">`1-C_N(5|3,1)=1-0.97724987=0.02275013`</span> )</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that iMathAS IS A CALCULATOR. You can enter "1-0.97724987" rather than "0.02275013". BE CAREFUL OF ROUNDING ERRORS! Unless specified by the question, give at least four decimal places to ensure that your answer is within the default tolerance.</p>
<p>There will be a variety of mathematical expressions used in this assignment; some of which you might be familiar with, some of which you are not. You do not need to memorize <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></em></strong> of these expressions. Rather, you should focus instead on interpreting the notation and teasing apart the situation so that the key assumptions about the stochastic process and stochastic variable stand out to you. My goal with this assignment is to provide you with experiences so that you can build your own arsenal of reference situations. These reference situations consist of particular assumptions about stochastic processes and stochastic variables that researchers commonly encounter in the act of doing science.</p>

Common Named Distributions
SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<p>Here is information about some of the most common Named Distributions that are in HW #3.4 and that we'll talk about during the semester.</p>
<p>Note: while I present the functions using notation and ideas from Calculus, STP226/STP231 students are not required to know the calculus.&nbsp; STP420 students should understand what ideas from Calculus are at play.&nbsp; For all students, you do not need to memorize any of these functions.</p>
</div>
TEXT
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<h2>Quick Links<a id="top"></a></h2>
<p>Continuous Distributions: <a href="#CU">Continuous Uniform</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#N">Normal (Gaussian)</a> <a href="#LN">Log-normal</a></p>
<p>Discrete Distributions:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#DU">Discrete Uniform</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Bern">Bernoulli</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Bin">Binomial</a> <a href="#Poi"> Poisson</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Continuous Uniform Distributions<a id="CU"></a></h2>
<p>Our stochastic variable in these situations will yield continuous numeric data (for any two adjacent values, we anticipate that we can zoom in and find more numbers between the original two values; we can repeat this zooming forever). In this type of situation we assume that the stochastic variable can be any value between (and including) lower and upper bounds, `a` and `b`, respectively. This is to say that if we let `X` represent our stochastic variable `a le X le b`. The hallmark of a continuous uniform situation is that we assume that accumulation of outcomes occurs are a constant rate of change (RoC). The RoC function in these continuous uniform situations is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="R_{CU}(x|a,b)={(1/(b-a),if a le x le b\),(0, if text{otherwise.}):}">`R_{CU}(x|a,b)={(1/(b-a),if a le x le b\),(0, if text{otherwise.}):}`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The distribution function (cumulative probability function; CPF) for continuous uniform distributions is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="C_{CU}(x|a,b)={(0,if x &amp;lt; a),((x-a)/(b-a),if a le x le b),(1, if x &amp;gt; b):}">`C_{CU}(x|a,b)={(0,if x &lt; a),((x-a)/(b-a),if a le x le b),(1, if x &gt; b):}`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the continuous uniform situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Continuous Uniform Distribution over the closed interval <span class="AM" title="[a,b]">`[a,b]`</span>&nbsp;. We denote this with the expression <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span> ⁓<span class="AM" title="Uni(a,b)">`Uni(a,b)`</span> or &nbsp;or <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span>&nbsp;⁓<span class="AM" title="CU(n,p)">`CU(n,p)`</span> .</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Normal (Gaussian) Distributions<a id="N"></a></h2>
<p>When we are dealing with whole populations that include individuals of every type and we are looking at a stochastic variable whose values are continuous, we have a strong possibility of having a normal (Gaussian) situation. When we consider the heights of human adults, the situation is often a normal situation. The theory around normal situations is well developed. This has lead to the development of "standardization" (or "normalization") techniques so that researchers can make use of the theory behind normal situations. In terms of practice, histograms that are symmetric and bell-shaped are typically (but not always) associated with normal distributions. Finally, we can often approximate the long-run behavior of more complex situations through a normal situation. If you are studying individuals who are suffering from illness and the stochastic variable is linked to the illness, the normal situation almost never applies.</p>
<p>The Rate of Change (RoC) for a Normal (Gaussian) Distribution is given by&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="R_{N}(x|mu,sigma^2)=1/(root[2]{2 pi sigma^2})exp(-frac{(x-mu)^2}{2sigma^2})">`R_{N}(x|mu,sigma^2)=1/(root[2]{2 pi sigma^2})exp(-frac{(x-mu)^2}{2sigma^2})`</span></p>
<p>where the parameter&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="mu">`mu`</span>&nbsp; is the expected value of the stochastic variable (assume that we know this value and assume that <span class="AM" title="-oo leq mu leq +oo">`-oo leq mu leq +oo`</span>&nbsp;) and the parameter&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="sigma^2">`sigma^2`</span>&nbsp; is the variance of the stochastic variable (also assume that we know this value and that <span class="AM" title="0 &amp;lt; sigma^2">`0 &lt; sigma^2`</span>&nbsp;). We will further assume that the stochastic variable is unbounded. That is to say that we will assume that theoretically the stochastic variable can take on any value;&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="-oo &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; +oo">`-oo &lt; x &lt; +oo`</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The distribution function (cumulative probability function; CPF) for normal (Gaussian) distributions is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="C_{N}(x|mu,sigma^2)=int_(-oo)^xR_{N}(t|mu,sigma^2)dt">`C_{N}(x|mu,sigma^2)=int_(-oo)^xR_{N}(t|mu,sigma^2)dt`</span>`</p>
<p>Don't worry about getting bogged down with mathematical notation. Keep in mind what a CPF tells us: the accumulated probability for all values of the stochastic variable less than or equal to x. When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the normal situation we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Normal Distribution with expected value `mu` and variance `sigma^2`. We denote this with the expression `X ⁓N(mu,sigma^2)`.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Log-normal Distributions<a id="LN"></a></h2>
<p>As we discussed in Unit 1, there are times when the values of a stochastic variable are not meaningfully combined using addition. For some of these cases, we can meaningfully combine the values using multiplication. Stochastic variables of this form tend to be multiplicative in nature (think about the rate of <em> E. coli</em> growth, the Average Rate of Change (ARoC) of bull weight gain from Test 1, or percentages). When we have stochastic variables such as these, we have a Log-normal distribution. The values of these stochastic variables are always positive (zero and negative values are not allowed).</p>
<p>There is a second set of situations that also have stochastic variables that follow Log-normal distributions: skewed histograms. When we anticipate (and observe) either a few extremely large values or a few extremely small values (but <strong>not both</strong>; typically large values), we will have a skewed histogram. If you think back to the third moment of a distribution, you are looking for a number away from zero. When you look at the histogram, you'll see one modal clump and then there will be a "tail" of values extending out for a quite a ways in one direction or the other. For a box-and-whisker plot, one whisker will be visually much longer than than the other.</p>
<p>The Rate of Change (RoC) for a Log-normal Distribution is given by <span class="AM" title="R_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=1/(x sigma root[2]{2 pi})exp(-frac{(log(x)-mu)^2}{2(sigma)^2})">`R_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=1/(x sigma root[2]{2 pi})exp(-frac{(log(x)-mu)^2}{2(sigma)^2})`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the parameter <span class="AM" title="mu">`mu`</span> is a location parameter (assume that we know this value and assume that <span class="AM" title="-oo leq mu leq +oo">`-oo leq mu leq +oo`</span>&nbsp;) and the parameter <span class="AM" title="sigma">`sigma`</span>&nbsp; is the scale parameter (also assume that we know this value and that <span class="AM" title="0 lt sigma">`0 lt sigma`</span>&nbsp;). We will further assume that the stochastic variable is <strong>partially bounded</strong>. This is to say that we'll assume that the stochastic variable can take on any value in a certain interval; typically this interval is <span class="AM" title="(0,+oo)">`(0,+oo)`</span>.</p>
<p>The distribution function (cumulative probability function; CPF) for normal (Gaussian) distributions is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="C_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=int_(0)^xR_{LN}(t|mu,sigma)dt">`C_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=int_(0)^xR_{LN}(t|mu,sigma)dt`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the Log-normal situation we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Log-normal Distribution with location <span class="AM" title="mu">`mu`</span>&nbsp; and scale <span class="AM" title="sigma">`sigma`</span>&nbsp;. We denote this with the expression <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span>⁓<span class="AM" title="LOGN(mu,sigma)">`LOGN(mu,sigma)`</span>.</p>

<h2>Discrete Uniform Distributions<a id="DU"></a></h2>
<p>You are already familiar with situations that involve stochastic variables that follow discrete uniform distributions. From flipping coins, to rolling dice, to running lotteries, and spinning spinners, you've worked with the stochastic processes that underpin these discrete uniform distributions since childhood. There are two assumptions that we make in these situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>that we have a known and fixed number of outcomes possible (e.g., Heads or Tails; the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; the integers 1-69 on white balls and the integers 1-26 on red balls for the Powerball lottery)</li>
<li>that the process is "fair", each outcome has the same long-run relative frequency of occurring (in other words, we're dealing with chance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rate of Change function for a discrete uniform stochastic variable is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="DU(x|N)=1/N">`DU(x|N)=1/N`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the parameter <span class="AM" title="N">`N`</span>&nbsp; is the total number of possible (and unique) outcomes of the stochastic process. Recall that for continuous stochastic variables, the accumulation of outcomes happens in a smooth and continuous way. This is not the case for discrete stochastic variables. Rather, the accumulation occurs in bursts. This is what enables us to be able to say that for some values of the stochastic variable that the probability of being an exact value is not always zero; that is to say that <span class="AM" title="P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0">`P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0`</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The probability at any particular value is given by <span class="AM" title="1/N times Delta x">`1/N times Delta x`</span>&nbsp;, where <span class="AM" title="Delta x">`Delta x`</span>&nbsp; is the change between any two adjacent values (which is always 1 for discrete cases). The distribution function is still the accumulation of stochastic process outcomes and the interpretation is the same. However, instead of using the integral from calculus, we need the discrete analog: summation.</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="C_{DU}(x|N)=sum_{j=1}^x(1/N times Delta x)">`C_{DU}(x|N)=sum_{j=1}^x(1/N times Delta x)`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the summation begins at 1 and we let&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="j">`j`</span>&nbsp; index the possible outcomes rather than using the actual values of the stochastic variable. This indexing gives us some flexibility to account for more situations (e.g., flipping coins). About the only time that you will make use of discrete uniform situations is in the selection of participants; these situations are not common in biological work.</p>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the discrete uniform situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Discrete Uniform Distribution with `N` possible outcomes. We denote this with the expression <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span>⁓<span class="AM" title="DU(N)">`DU(N)`</span> .</p>

<h2>Bernoulli Distributions<a id="Bern"></a></h2>
<p>Imagine a situation where you have a stochastic process. Now suppose that you take all of the possible outcomes and assign each one to one of two camps: what you're looking for and everything else. The values that you are looking for you will call "successes" while you will call all of the other values "failures". While there is a stochastic variable in the background, you have created a new stochastic variable which only has two possible values. Here are some examples of such situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flipping a coin and only being interested in "Heads"</li>
<li>Looking for "defective" parts out of a manufactured lot</li>
<li>Whether cancer has metastasized</li>
<li>Whether a person has an autoimmune disease</li>
</ul>
<p>This allow us to condense a bunch of information into a string of 1s and 0s so that we can examine a phenomenon through a courser lens (i.e., taking a step back and looking at a bigger picture). Success or failure (1 or 0) gives us a discrete stochastic variable but we don't need to assume that success has the same chance as occurring as failure. We'll let <span class="AM" title="p">`p`</span> represent the probability of success; since total probability must be 1, this means that probability of 'failure' must be <span class="AM" title="1-p">`1-p`</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The Rate of Change function for a discrete uniform stochastic variable is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="Ber(x|p)={(p,if x=1 text{ ('success')}),(1-p,if x=0 text{ ('failure')}):}">`Ber(x|p)={(p,if x=1 text{ ('success')}),(1-p,if x=0 text{ ('failure')}):} `</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the parameter <span class="AM" title="p">`p`</span>is the probability of success. Recall that for continuous stochastic variables, the accumulation of outcomes happens in a smooth and continuous way. This is not the case for discrete stochastic variables. Rather, the accumulation occurs in bursts. This is what enables us to be able to say that for some values of the stochastic variable that the probability of being an exact value is not always zero; that is to say that <span class="AM" title="P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0">`P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0`</span>.</p>
<p>We will not worry about dealing with stochastic variables with Bernoulli distributions in this course. Rather, these stochastic variables serve as useful stepping stones to second-order stochastic processes.</p>

<h2>Binomial Distributions<a id="Bin"></a></h2>
<p>By this point in time, you've looked at the distributions of several continuous stochastic variables (continuous uniform, normal (Gaussian), and log-normal). You've also looked at two distributions for discrete stochastic variables; the discrete uniform and the Bernoulli. For the Bernoulli distribution, we're not interested in whether or not we have a success or failure but rather <em>how many</em> successes (or failures) we have.</p>
<p>When we fix the number of Bernoulli trials that we're going to examine to <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span>&nbsp;, we can count the number of successes out of these <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span>&nbsp; trials. This count becomes the attribute of interest. Notice that this attribute is an attribute of a sequence (a data collection), not of an individual object/living being. The implication here is that we need a second-order stochastic process to get realizations of our stochastic variable of interest (for the attribute number of successes). We need a first-order stochastic process to get the <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span>&nbsp; Bernoulli trials, and then an additional step of counting the number of successes in those <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; trials. The number of successes that we record is the result of one trial of the second-order stochastic process. When are stochastic variable of interest relates to the number of successes and we're dealing with a second-order stochastic process with a fixed number of trials, we say that we have a Binomial situation.</p>
<p>The Rate of Change function for a binomial stochastic variable is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="B(x|n,p)=(n!)/(x!(n-x)!)p^x(1-p)^(n-x)">`B(x|n,p)=(n!)/(x!(n-x)!)p^x(1-p)^(n-x)`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the parameter <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span>&nbsp; is the number of Bernoulli trials and <span class="AM" title="p">`p`</span>&nbsp; is the probability of success (on any one independent trial). Recall that for continuous stochastic variables, the accumulation of outcomes happens in a smooth and continuous way. This is not the case for discrete stochastic variables. Rather, the accumulation occurs in bursts. This is what enables us to be able to say that for some values of the stochastic variable that the probability of being an exact value is not always zero; that is to say that <span class="AM" title="P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0">`P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0`</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The probability at any particular value is given by <span class="AM" title="(n!)/(x!(n-x)!)p^x(1-p)^(n-x) times Delta x">`(n!)/(x!(n-x)!)p^x(1-p)^(n-x) times Delta x`</span>, where <span class="AM" title="Delta x">`Delta x`</span>&nbsp; is the change between any two adjacent values (which is always 1 for discrete cases). The distribution function is still the accumulation of stochastic process outcomes and the interpretation is the same. However, instead of using the integral from calculus, we need the discrete analog: summation.</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="C_{B}(x|n,p)=sum_{j=0}^x((n!)/(j!(n-j)!)p^j(1-p)^(n-j) times Delta j)">`C_{B}(x|n,p)=sum_{j=0}^x((n!)/(j!(n-j)!)p^j(1-p)^(n-j) times Delta j)`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the summation begins at 0 (as the fewest number of successes we can have is none) and we let<span class="AM" title="j">`j`</span> index the number of successes.</p>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the binomial situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a binomial distribution for <span class="AM" title="n">`n`</span> trials and with probability&nbsp;<span class="AM" title="p">`p`</span>&nbsp; of success. We denote this with the expression <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span>⁓<span class="AM" title="B(n,p)">`B(n,p)`</span> or <span class="AM" title="X">`X`</span> ⁓ <span class="AM" title="B\text{in}(n,p)">`B\text{in}(n,p)`</span>.</p>

<h2>Poisson Distributions<a id="Poi"></a></h2>
<p>Related to the binomial distribution is one of the more useful distributions in biology; the Poisson distribution. Recall that for the binomial situations, we imagined carrying out a fixed number of Bernoulli trials. For Poisson situations, we're going to now imagine that we have an infinite number of Bernoulli trials where we still want to count the number of successes (or failures) that occur. We can think of Poisson situations as entailing us "waiting" as the infinite Bernoulli trials move past us. Here "waiting" does not automatically refer to the passage of time. Rather we could "wait" as we move through some region of space (such as a forest, a field, or a desert) or we could "wait" through a block of text looking for typographical errors. Common Poisson situations include looking at the number of inbound phone calls made in a minute to a call center, the number of entities of a particular species within a particular area, and the number of errors found in a block of printed text.</p>
<p>The Rate of Change function for a Poisson stochastic variable is given by</p>
<p><span class="AM" title="P(x|lambda)=(e^(-lambda)lambda^x)/(x!)">`P(x|lambda)=(e^(-lambda)lambda^x)/(x!)`</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the parameter <span class="AM" title="lambda">`lambda`</span>&nbsp; is the rate of "success"; this is to say that `lambda` is the expected number of "successes" per a given unit that we're examining. For instance, if we're looking at the number of white-tail deer there are in Nebraska and we've broken all of Nebraska into chunks of 1 square mile, then we could have `lambda=3.2`. We'd interpret this as saying that we expect 3.2 white-tail deer per square mile. Recall that for continuous stochastic variables, the accumulation of outcomes happens in a smooth and continuous way. This is not the case for discrete stochastic variables. Rather, the accumulation occurs in bursts. This is what enables us to be able to say that for some values of the stochastic variable that the probability of being an exact value is not always zero; that is to say that `P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0`.</p>
<p>The probability at any particular value is given by `(e^(-lambda)lambda^x)/(x!) times Delta x`, where `Delta x` is the change between any two adjacent values (which is always 1 for discrete cases). The distribution function is still the accumulation of stochastic process outcomes and the interpretation is the same. However, instead of using the integral from calculus, we need the discrete analog: summation.</p>
<p>`C_{P}(x|lambda)=sum_{j=0}^x((e^(-lambda)lambda^j)/(j!) times Delta j)`</p>
<p>Notice that the summation begins at 0 (as the fewest number of successes we can have is none) and we let `j` index the number of successes.</p>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the Poisson situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Poisson distribution with `lambda` rate of success. We denote this with the expression `X ⁓Poi(lambda)`.</p>

TITLE
Moving between Probability Notation and Distribution Function Notation
SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<p>This page contains how you can move back and forth between Probability Notation and Distribution Function Notation.</p>
</div>
TEXT
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<p>As you work on HW #3.4 and HW #3.5, you will be working with Distribution Function Notation. However, you should keep in mind moving back and forth between Probability Notation and Function Notation. Often times Probability Notation is easier to write based on the question posed in the situation. Then from the Probability Notation, you can move into using Distribution Function Notation.</p>
<p>A couple of things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>While Probability Notation represents a probability value, the expression IS NOT a function nor does the expression invoke/call on any formula.</li>
<li>Probability Notation can be used with any of the six types of events (<span class="AM" title="=, ne, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, le, ge">`=, ne, &lt;, &gt;, le, ge`</span> ) as well as compound events</li>
<ul>
<li>Compound events are combinations of the six types using AND and OR</li>
<li>E.g., <span class="AM" title="3&amp;lt;yle 4">`3&lt;yle 4`</span> is the same as <span class="AM" title="3&amp;lt;y">`3&lt;y`</span> AND <span class="AM" title="yle4">`yle4`</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;E.g., <span class="AM" title="yle5">`yle5`</span> OR <span class="AM" title="y&amp;gt;32.5">`y&gt;32.5`</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The invoked formula is either a summation for discrete stochastic variables or an integral for continuous stochastic variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distribution Function Notation ONLY deals with one type of event, <span class="AM" title="le">`le`</span>; thus, we have to use transformations to convert the other Probability Notations into Distribution Function Notation.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The most common transformation deals with the idea of the complement of an event. (See Lecture slides.)</li>
<li>The second most common transformation deals with compound events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a listing of how you can transform Probability Notation into Distribution Function Notation (and vice versa). I've listed out which transformations work for BOTH continuous and discrete stochastic variables, and which work for one or the other. We will assume that we've defined our stochastic variable as <em>W</em> and we'll assume that <em>W</em> follows a generic distribution,&nbsp;<em>D</em>, with a set of parameters, <span class="AM" title="theta">`theta`</span> . I'm using this generic Distribution so that these transformations can be applied to <em><strong>all</strong></em> of the named distributions we've worked with. Additionally, while I'll only list <span class="AM" title="theta">`theta`</span> once, keep in mind that we can think about <span class="AM" title="theta">`theta`</span> as holding the place of all of the parameters. Any number that is listed is arbitrarily chosen. So without further ado, assume that <span class="AM" title="W">`W`</span> ⁓ <span class="AM" title="D(theta)">` D(theta)`</span> .</p>

HW #3.5-Distribution Functions and Long-run Behavior, pt. 2
SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
<h2>Distributions and Long-run Behavior, part 2</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>9/28/17, 11:20pm: I've set this to minimum threshold of 10 points.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>NOTE: This assignment will only open after you've accumulated at least 48 points on HW #3.4.</strong></span></p>
<p>This homework assignment serves as an opportunity for you to continually work and wrestle with the ideas of probability, distributions, and distribution functions (a.k.a. cumulative density functions and cumulative probability functions), function notation, along with the other core ideas of Unit 3 (stochastic processes, stochastic variables, randomness, accumulation).</p>
<p>You'll be presented with seven situations that are similar to those you worked with in HW #3.4. However, none of these seven situations is labelled as being an example of a certain reference situation. Rather, your task is to put your knowledge of reference situations and distributions into practice to identify which situation is which.</p>
<p>For each situation, you will need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Define the stochastic variable of interest.</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate distribution for the stochastic variable and why.</li>
<li>Describe a stochastic process that works given the situation at hand, identifying any parameters and their values as necessary</li>
<li>Answer the question posed in the situation...</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Using Function Notation and</li>
<li>Giving a numerical answer (use the the <a href="https://mathpost.asu.edu/~neil/statCalc/statcalc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stat Calculator</a>)</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h2>Exploring the Class Survey Data, Part A</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">For this assignment, you will need to download the class survey data and attempt to answer the central question of Exploratory Data Analysis, "What do we have?". To do this, you will prepare a data visualization using what you have learned from the readings (Tufte and Kosslyn) and class discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">You will prepare a document (*.DOCX) that contains the following:</span></p>

<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A data visualization of your own construction, using whichever attributes you have access to in the Class Survey data.<br /></span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Your Visualization should look professional; i.e., your visualization should NOT be a screenshot. You can copy-paste visualizations from JMP with relative easy.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you don't remember how to copy-paste visualizations out of JMP and can't find the spot in the video, ask for help.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A paragraph that accompanies your visualization that discusses the data story of your visualization.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">You must upload your assignment to CrowdGrader by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, 1/25/17.</span><br /></span></p>
<h2>Exploring the Class Survey Data, Part B</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you (and your classmates) have uploaded your document to CrowdGrader, you will need to return to CrowdGrader and review three (3) of your fellow classmate's submissions. NOTE: all reviews are anonymous. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">You must complete your reviews by 4:35 pm on Monday, 1/30/17.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">To assist with designing your initial visualization and with your peer-reviews, you need to consult the following rubric: <a class="attach" href="/filestore/ufiles/2024/DVRubric.pdf" target="_blank">DVRubric.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Your grade for this assignment will be based on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">The consensus scores your peers give according to the DV Rubric for your visualization</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">The reviews that YOU provide to your peers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">My assessment of your work and your reviews</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
INTRO
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">For this assignment, you will need to download the class survey data and attempt to answer the central question of Exploratory Data Analysis, "What do we have?". To do this, you will prepare a data visualization using what you have learned from the readings (Tufte and Kosslyn) and class discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">You will prepare a document (*.DOCX) that contains the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">A data visualization of your own construction, using whichever attributes you have access to in the Class Survey data.<br /></span></li>

SUMMARY
<h2>Exploring the Class Survey Data, Part 2</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In this second part of exploring the class survey data, you will need to submit three files:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>A Change Log for the Class Survey Data</strong>. Your change log may be in whatever format you found useful for yourself. The only conditions are that I have to be able to open the file and that you cannot count a cleaned data file as your change log. If you forgot to keep one as you cleaned the class survey data, don't fret. Recall that JMP has the Compare Data Tables tool that can help you located what you changed.</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Your uploaded file should have your name (first and last) as part of the file name.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>An Updated Version of Data Visualization 1 (HW #1.5)</strong>. This is your opportunity to take the feedback that you received in HW #1.5 and improve upon your data visualization and accompanying text. If you don't feel that you need to make any alterations, please upload your file anyways. (Note: I'm of the opinion that there's always rooms for improvement, even if you've maxed out rubric categories.)</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Your uploaded file should be in the DOCX format and have your name (first and last) as part of the file name.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>An Exploratory Data Analysis Narrative</strong>. Using the class survey data, you will select three (3) attributes and write a narrative about what you (and your reader) can learn about the class using these three attributes. Your narrative should include the following:</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Three (3) univariate descriptions: discuss each of the three attributes singularly; use appropriate data visualizations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Three (3) bivariate descriptions: discuss the interactions of when you look at each of the three possible pairings of the three attributes (i.e., A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. C); use appropriate data visualizations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">A multivariate description: discuss the interactions of all three attributes as they interact with each other. You should have at least one data visualization here; you might consider including multiple visualizations. (There are times when looking at A vs. B vs. C shows one story while looking at C vs. A vs. B will show another story.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Your uploaded file should be in the DOCX format and have your name (first and last) as part of the file name.</span></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For an example of such a narrative, please see this example: <a class="attach" href="/filestore/ufiles/2024/EDANarrativeExample.pdf" target="_blank">EDANarrativeExample.pdf</a>.</span></p>
INTRO
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Upload your three files as directed in each question.<br /></span></p>

<h2>Quantifying Variation as Inconsistency</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Continue working in your table groups to come up with how to quantify inconsistency within a data collection. Your end goal is for your table group to generate your own statistic that provides a measure of "variation as inconsistency" and then to apply your statistic to the four test data sets (attached to this posting). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">While there is no correct answer, <strong>your group must be ready to present what you developed on Wednesday, 3/22/17.</strong> <br /></span></p>

SUMMARY
<div style="font-size: 12pt;">
<h2>Statistical Inference</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will put into practice what you've learned during Unit 4 (plus the other units) to engage in statistical inference.</p>
<p>For each question, you will be presented with a situation, client data, and the client's research question. You must then do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Identify the correct method to investigate the question (this may include replication, permutation, bootstrapping, Monte Carlo simulation, or parametric/nonparametric shortcut methods)</li>
<li>Propose null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
<li>Use JMP to perform any and all necessary calculations.</li>
<li>Write up a conclusion for the client.</li>
</ol>
None of the situations are marked as to which method you should use AND there are multiple logical answers that you could take. You will record your answers in the space provided. You will have three spaces in which to work:</div>
<div style="font-size: 12pt;">
<ol>
<li>You will have a "scratch" area where you may record notes to yourself (not graded but useful for me to see what you're thinking about); I recommend using this area to record information from Part C.</li>
<li>Test Selection Area (Graded-5 pts): Use this area for Parts A and B. Be sure to include a justification for your choices.</li>
<li>Conclusion Area (Graded-10 pts): This is where you will write up a paragraph (or two) to explain to the client what you found and what the results mean (Part D).</li>
</ol>
This format best matches what you would do in practice (life isn't labelled) and matches what you will be expected to do on your Final Exam.</div>
<div style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-size: 12pt;">NOTE: I've activated "Shuffle" on the item order; thus, each student has a different order to the problems. If you need to ask me question, PLEASE either come in and see me OR use the link at the bottom of each problem.</div>

<p>What did the visualizations hide about the London Cholera outbreak data?</p>
$answerbox

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<p>The time series displays hide any information that we might glean about causality. Additionally, different time intervals can exaggerate or hide features. For example, when looking at the week-long time series displays, the impact of Snow's removal of the pump handle is greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Monmonier's (and Tufte's) maps highlight that we need to be careful of the geographic subdivisions we use, just like time intervals. Different subdivisions can support or refute the same causal theory.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<p>Tufte argues that there are better and worse methods for displaying and analyzing data. The better methods include paying attention to several aspects including appropriate media for assessing cause-and-effect, making comparisons, considering and explaining outliers (not automatically dismissing them), and accounting for possible errors.</p>

  Recall the slide about "Asking the <em>Right</em> Questions". What kinds of questions appear to guide the researchers whose work Tufte describes?
</p>
<br>
$answerbox

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary; one possible answer is:</h3>
<p>The three questions of "What do we have?", "How does <em>this</em> compare to <em>that</em>?" and "If we have <em>these</em>, how can we predict <em>that</em>?" are at the core of the analytical activities in designing visual displays of data. In this set of readings, the first two questions are what most of the displays seek to answer.</p>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answer will vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<h4>Comparisons</h4>
</li>
<p>The first principle tackles one of the fundamental aspects of Statistics: making comparisons (i.e., identifying similarities and differences). Comparisons allow us to better understand some phenomenon as well as enhancing the context in which our statistical research questions live.</p>
<li>
<h4>Causality, Mechanism, Structure, Explanation</h4>
</li>
<p>By focusing on causal explanations for elements we as similar or different in making comparisons, we're disposed to hypothesize answers to questions of <em>why</em> these similarities/differences exist. By looking at mechanisms and structure within the data, we push the "why" question further and propose <em>how</em> the similarities/differences can be capitalized in future research.</p> 
<li>
<h4>Multivariate Analysis</h4>
</li>
<p>The world does not exist within a single variable. Relatively few phenomena are simple; the vast majority are complex, involving many factors which can be interrelated. To better understand what is going on within the data, to make stronger comparisons, and to build solid, evidence based hypotheses, we must frame our data analysis within a multivariate context.</p>
<li>
<h4>Integration of Evidence</h4>
</li>
<p>By using words, numbers, and visualizations together (as a unified whole), we better enable our readers/consumers to see what we see and develop understandings that are consistent with what we wished to convey.</p>
<li>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
</li>
<p>Part of analytical design hinges on the integrity of the data and analysis. Readers will each perceive the credibility of the analysis by what they have access to. By providing documentation, full scales, limitations, and disclosing any potential conflicts of interest, authors can step in the right direction for building up readers' trust.</p>
<li>
<h4>Content Counts Most of All</h4>
</li>
<p>The computing axiom "Garbage In, Garbage Out" highlights this principle. The content of any data visualization ultimately drives the success or failure of the visualization.</p>

<h3>Applying What You've Learned</h3>
<p>Tufte explained the six principles using Minard's map of the French Invasion of Russia. Using that as your model, apply the six principles to John Snow's map of London dealing with the outbreak of cholera.<br /><img src="/filestore/ufiles/2024/mceclip1-1483740700465.png" alt="Snow's Cholera Map" width="480" /></p>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><h4>Comparisons</h4></li>
<p>Snow's map shows comparisons by revealing the locations of the cholera-related deaths occurring in some areas but not others.</p>
<li><h4>Causality, Mechanism, Structure, Explanation</h4></li>
<p>By including the locations of wells/pumps in addition to the locations of cholera-related deaths, Snow provided evidence for his hypothesis that something was going on with the pumps.</p>
<li><h4>Multivariate Analysis</h4></li>
<p>Snow included not just locations of deaths, but the number of deaths, as well as the locations of pumps in his map.</p>
<li><h4>Integration of Evidence</h4></li>
<p>Snow integrates the names of streets and important landmarks (e.g., work house, brewery, Golden Square, etc.) to help readers get some sense of the area the map shows. We are told in the reading that Snow accompanied the map with paragraphs that provide more details.</p>
<li><h4>Documentation</h4></li>
<p>Snow is light on the inclusion of documentation. He does not include any sources in the map. However, he does include some documentation in the associated paragraphs.</p>
<li><h4>Content Counts Most of All</h4></li>
<p>Snow's map focuses on the locations of cholera-related deaths in an attempt to figure out a potential cause of the outbreak. By focusing on this goal, he kept adornment to a minimum so that the data could speak unimpeded.</p>

For this question, you will need to bring up the following web application: <a href="https://mathpost.asu.edu/~neil/FishSampling.html" target="_blank">Fish Sampling</a><br><br>
This question will step you through how to use the Fish Sampling application. Please follow all of the instructions so that you can accurately replicate the problem. After each question, the correct answer appears as hover text. This provides you with the opportunity to check that you've used the application correctly.<br><br>
An icthyologist is curious about the fish in a certain body of water. She decides that she is going to carry out the following stochastic process: Supposing that there is a fixed number of fish (30 goldfish, 20 clownfish, and 10 angelfish) in the body of water, I'll assign a unique ID to each fish and I'll also write the ID on a ping-pong ball. I'll then put all of the ping-pong balls into a big bowl and draw 20 ping-pong balls without replacement. The 20 fish who correspond with the drawn IDs will be the 20 fish that I'll capture and record their breed, their height (in cm), and their length (in cm).<br><br>
Use a seed value of $NLseed, the Fish Sampling application, and the above situation to answer the following questions.
<ol type=A>
  <li>How many stochastic variables is the icthyologist interested in? [AB0] $note0</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>Which stochastic variables are qualitiative? If there are not any qualitative stochastic variables, write "none".</li>
    [AB1] $note1
    <li>What is the measurement unit for the quantiative stochastic variables? [AB2] $note2 </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Set up the Fish Sampling application.</li>
  <ol type=1 start=0>
    <li>Set the seed value to $NLseed.</li>
    <li>Set the fish population numbers.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of Goldfish (numofgoldfish): 30</li>
      <li>Number of Clownfish (numofclownfish): 20</li>
      <li>Number of Angelfish (numofangelfish): 10</li>
      <li>Press "Setup".</li>
      <li>What is the color of the right-most fish? [AB3] $note3</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li>What type of sampling method has the icthyologist described in her stochastic process? [AB4] $note4</li>
  <li>How large of sample is the icthyologist going to take? [AB5] $note5</li>
  <li>Set up the sampling method.</li>
  <ol type=1 start=2>
    <li>Choose the appropriate method from the SamplingMethod dropdown box and set necessary parameter values.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Select "Simple Random Sampling" from the dropdown list.</li>
      <li>Set samplesize to $answer[5].</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Press "Establish Sampling Frame".</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Did anything get displayed in the output window (the box outlined in yellow)? [AB6] $note6</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Press "Show IDs".</li>
    <ul>
      <li>What color is Fish 52? [AB7] $note7</li>
      <li>Press "Get Sample". List the ID numbers of the sample.</li>
      [AB8] $note8
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li>Collect the data.</li>
  <ol type=1 start=5>
    <li>Get the Heights and Lengths of the sampled fish.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Press "Get Heights". What is the smallest height? [AB9] $note9</li>
      <li>Prese "Get Lengths". What is the longest length? [AB10] $note10</li>

Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that consists of the progressive atrophy of brain tissue.  While scientists do not fully understand the causes of Alzheimer's, often researchers and doctors are concerned about the age at diagnosis of patients.  Early-onset Alzheimer's disease accounts for the cases where the age at diagnosis is no more than 65 years old.  Assuming the that typical age at onset is 77 years (which is a location index) and there is a scale index of 1.15, what percent of time should doctors expect the diagnosis of Early-onset Alzheimer's (given we know the patient has Alzheimer's)?<br>

<p>Explain the differences between a first-order stochastic process and a second-order stochastic process.</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>While both the first-order and second-order stochastic processes are infinitely repeatable methods, what we get as values of at the end of each trial (i.e., the processes' outcome) is different. For a first-order stochastic process, each trial allows us the "realize" the stochastic variable for a particular object/being (i.e., we get that object's/being's value of the stochastic variable). We can think about this as getting our "raw data". The second-order stochastic process makes use of a first-order process that we only repeat <em>n</em> times. We then use this sample to calculate the value of some statistic. The value of the statistic is what we're "realizing" in the second-order stochastic process.</p>

<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<p>The original data displays give information on blow-by and erosion on the o-rings. There was also some limited information dealing with temperature. The visualizations used in the congressional hearings included much of the same data. There were some additional visualizations such as the scatterplot showing the number of incidents and temperature at launch.</p>

  [AB7]
</ol>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary, but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<ol type="A">
  <li><h4>Relevance</h4></li>
  <p>You need to decide upon what message your want to communicate to your audience and reduce the data to only that which speaks to that message.</p>
  <li><h4>Appropriate Knowledge</h4></li>
  <p>Keep you audience in mind as you put together your visualizations and materials. Make sure that any language you use is accessible to your audience; be aware of any cultural implications in your choices of symbols, characters, colors, etc.</p>
  <li><h4>Salience</h4></li>
  <p>The most instantly recognizable features of your visualization should convey the most important information. The Salience principle focuses on the the visualization as a whole.</p>
  <li><h4>Discriminability</h4></li>
  <p>The Discriminability principle is related to the Salience principle, but focuses on elements within the visualization. As an individual scans the visualization, the individual should recognize changes in the underlying data as appearing in the visualization. For instance, the viewer should be able to distinguish where there is a change in the following string <font color=#D76AF1>BB</font><font color=#D76AF2>BB</font><font color=#D76AF9>BB</font>. There are actually three separate colors used in the string of B's. This string is an example of poor Discriminability. To adhere to the principle of Discriminability, there should be a noticeable visual change to reflect changes in the underlying data; for example <font color=#9F1F66>BB</font><font color=#37115A>BB</font><font color=#D76AF9>BB</font>.</p>
  <li><h4>Perceptual Organization</h4></li>
  <p>We need to attend to the fact that the mind tends to group individual elements together. When you want to convey a particular message, you need to ensure that visualization that you create allows for the viewer to process the information in a natural way. If your visualization requires effort to decode or the message requires unnatural groupings, then your message will get lost in transmission.</p>
  <li><h4>Compatibility</h4></li>
  <p>The goals of a data visualization are to convey some message to another individual and to assist with analytical thinking.  If the format that the visualization takes is incompatible with the underlying message/analytical thinking, then the intended message could become distorted and/or lost. The choices of visualization type, color scheme, patterns, etc. play a role in ensuring that your intended message is conveyed to your viewer.</p>
  <li><h4>Informative Changes</h4></li>
  <p>Related to Salience and Discriminability, the Informative Changes principle means that when the viewer perceives some change in the visualization, then the viewer should take that perceived change as indicating that something is happening with the data and/or visualization.</p> 
  <li><h4>Capacity Limitations</h4></li>
  <p>The human mind can only focus a certain amount of information at a time. Visualizations that attempt to convey a lot of data can overwhelm the viewer, inhibiting the viewer's ability to understand your intended message.</p>
</ol>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary, but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<p>The anatomy of a graph is the basic structure that all data visualizations have. In general, there are three key parts to the anatomy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework: the general structure in which the data visualization such as horizontal and vertical axes. The framework provides an interpretative lens for the content.</li>
<li>Content: the data made visual through the use of lines, dots, shapes, filled regions, etc.</li>
<li>Labels: provide context to both the framework and content to help the viewer understand the data.</li>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary; an example is:</h3>
<p>These principles work together to assist creators of data visualizations in their choices during the design. By keeping in mind how their viewers might perceive their visualizations, creators can work to ensure that their message is conveyed in a consistent manner to their consumers. By the same token, consumers can use these principles as a means for critiquing visualizations.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary; one example is:</h3>
<p>The person first needs to decide whether he/she wants the viewer to be focusing on precise measurements or on relative amounts. If the goal is communicate precise amounts, then a data visualization (graph) is not appropriate. If rather the person intends to convey a message focus on relative amounts or overarching trends, then a data visualization is appropriate.</p>

<h3>
  Applying What You've Learned
</h3>
<p>
  Using Kosslyn's Eight-Fold Way and his recommendations, critique the following data visualization.<br>
  $img1<br>
  <em>Note: this graphic does not have the interactivity enabled.</em>
</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary, but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<p>To begin with, this data visualization is a mixed-type multiple pane visualization. The first pane is the scatter plot showing the 'average' freshmen net revenue versus the tuition and fees for the 2012-13 academic year. The second pane is a a set of side-by-side box plots, showing 'average freshman net revenue broken down by geographic region. As a whole, the data visualization is poor. I'll discuss the two panes individually.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>The Scatter plot</h3></li>
<ol type="A">
<li><h4>Relevance</h4></li>
<p>The assumed message is to show a connection between the 'average' freshman net revenue and the tuition and fees at different universities for the 2012-2013 academic year. The data does speak to this message.</p>
<li><h4>Appropriate Knowledge</h4></li>
<p>To fully make sense of the first pane, there are quite a few things that the viewer must know before looking at the visualization. The viewer must know that each dot represents a different university/college, they must know what constitutes "tuition and fees", they need to know what is meant by "'average' freshman net revenue", "enrollment profile", and "Pell". If a viewer does not have the appropriate background knowledge for any of these core ideas, he/she will inadvertently misinterpret the visualization. <em>Post-grading note: as I graded your critiques of this visualization, this is especially true. Many of you commented that you didn't know what was going on and several of you provided interpretations that are inconsistent with each other's interpretation as well as mine. You're not docked for this; I mention this to raise your awareness.</em></p>
<li><h4>Salience</h4></li>
<p>The designer's use of color helps to grab attention and highlight the trend that the higher the value of tuition and fees, the higher the value of 'average' freshman net revenue.</p>
<li><h4>Discriminability</h4></li>
<p>The scatter plot suffers greatly here. While colors separate out universities/colleges with different enrollment profiles, the shear number of points in the plot and how the designer added them to the plot, create unnecessary difficulty in reading values. Additionally, the use of the percentage of freshman with Pell [grants] as the factor behind size is a problem. While we can state that a bigger dot should have a higher percentage of freshman receiving Pell grants, we're not specifically told this. Consider the following photo snippet: <img src="/filestore/ufiles/2024/mceclip0-1486154347862.png"/>. The school represented by the orange dot, we would hope has the smaller percentage while the school represented by the red dot has the larger.  However, what we can't say is what percent of freshman at each school received Pell grants; not even a ball park figure. The creator did not provide a key that actually allows a viewer to discriminate the data values in a meaningful way.</p>
<li><h4>Perceptual Organization</h4></li>
<p>The colors help viewer to clump different universities/colleges together based on enrollment profile, however the layout encourages viewers to clump a lot of universities/colleges together through the overlapping of the points.</p>
<li><h4>Compatibility</h4></li>
<p>The scatter plot is compatible with the underlying message.</p>
<li><h4>Informative Changes</h4></li>
<p>The issues with informative changes ties back to appropriate knowledge. While a viewer can notice a difference in color, size of dot, or the dot's location, these changes are either hidden (especially for dots pushed to the background) or rely on the viewer to have a sufficient knowledge basis to know what that change represents. This is not necessarily ideal for a data visualization.</p>
<li><h4>Capacity Limitations</h4></li>
<p>The scatter plot is overwhelming due to the number of universities/colleges included in the plot. While there are only four attributes that work well together, the construction of this particular plot works against the designer's purposes rather than supporting.</p>
</ol>
<li><h3>Side-by-side Box plots</h3></li>
<ol type="A">
<li><h4>Relevance</h4></li>
<p>As before, the data used in the box plots works with the underlying message of looking at net revenue.</p>
<li><h4>Appropriate Knowledge</h4></li>
<p>Once again, the viewer is tasked with knowing a fair amount of information, prior to looking at the visualization. The major issue is the central attribute: 'average' freshman net revenue. The viewer needs to know what this value represents in order for the graphic to make sense. Additionally, the designer fails to alert the viewer to which type of box plot he/she used.</p>
<li><h4>Salience</h4></li>
<p>Salience is a weak point in the side-by-side box plots. The eye is not necessarily drawn to any one aspect of the visualization.</p>
<li><h4>Discriminability</h4></li>
<p>The shading of the points to reflect the tuition at each institution is difficult to discern.</p>
<li><h4>Perceptual Organization</h4></li>
<p>The addition of the points behind the box plots creates some issues. The boxes having seemingly different amounts of transparency which when viewed with dots, cause the two elements to start blending together.</p>
<li><h4>Compatibility</h4></li>
<p>The decision to give both box plots and a scatter plot, in addition to doing a side-by-side graphic in this second graph works against the message. The viewer is often left wondering what exactly the message is supposed to be.</p>
<li><h4>Informative Changes</h4></li>
<p>As noted for Salience, and Perceptual Organization, there are some issues with this side-by-side box plot. Additional issues include the scale on the vertical axis is too sparse for the viewer to read values; using this axis becomes more difficult the further to the right the viewer looks.</p>
<li><h4>Capacity Limitations</h4></li>
<p>While having fewer attributes than the scatter plot, this side-by-side box plot does task the viewer due to the decision to include all of the points behind the box-plots.</p>
</ol>

For this question, you will need to bring up the following web application: <a href="https://mathpost.asu.edu/~neil/FishSampling.html" target="_blank">Fish Sampling</a><br><br>
Just as with the prior question, this question will step you through using Fish Sampling application. Please follow all of the instructions so that you can accurately replicate the problem. Please note that not all of the answers are listed.<br><br>
An icthyologist is curious about the fish in a certain body of water which has four zones. She decides that she is going to carry out the following stochastic process: Supposing that there is a fixed number of fish (30 goldfish, 20 clownfish, and 10 angelfish) in the body of water, I'll assign a unique ID to four zones of the body of water. I'll then write these IDs onto four separate notecards; after shuffling the cards, I'll deal myself 6 cards. For each of the six zones selected (one for each card dealt), I'll drop a net and catch all of the fish in that zone, recording their breed, their height (in cm), and their length (in cm).<br><br>
Use a seed value of $NLseed, the Fish Sampling application, and the above situation to answer the following questions.
<ol type=A>
  <li>Set up the Fish Sampling application.</li>

For this question, you will need to bring up the following web application: <a href="https://mathpost.asu.edu/~neil/PeopleSamplingWeb.html" target="_blank">People Sampling</a><br><br>
This people sampling application is much like the Fish Sampling application. However, there are some important differences.
<ul>
  <li>Fish don't have the option to not participate but people do. We'll assume every person will agree to participate.</li>
  <li>Unlike the Fish Sampling application, the only sampling method available to you is simple random sampling.</li>
  <li>Unlike the Fish Sampling app where you enter a seed value where prompted, you will want to make sure you set "problem?" to the appropriate value.</li>
</ul>
Based upon what context you've been provided thus far, answer the following questions.
<ol type=A>
  <li>Define all necessary stochastic variables, one per line. If you do not need the line, enter "NA".</li>
  <ul>
    <li>[AB0]</li>
    <li>[AB1]</li>
    <li>[AB2]</li>
    <li>[AB3]</li>
    <li>[AB4]</li>
    <li>[AB5]</li>
    <li>[AB6]</li>
    <li>[AB7]</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Give two research questions that you believe that you could investigate and answer given the People Sampling application.</li>
  [AB8]
  <li>Describe a stochastic process that you would use to generate the data for these stochastic variables.</li>
  [AB9]
</ol>
Do not close the People Sampling App when you're finished with this question.

<h3>Oreo Data</h3>
<h4>$warning</h4>
<p>For this question, you will still need to look at cream filling masses broken out by the type of Oreo.  Additionally, you will need to make use of the Continuous Fit tools located in the Red Triangle menu next to the attribute name you used for cream filling mass. You will be looking at fitted Normal and Lognormal distributions; once you have these, click the Red Triangle next to the <strong>distribution name</strong> and call for the diagnostic plot. Define `V` as the mass (g) of cream filling in Oreo sandwich cookies and `mathcal{M}` be the collection of realizations of `V`.</p>
<p>Consider the three named continuous distributions we've discussed thus far; the continuous uniform, normal (Gaussian), and lognormal.</p> 
<ol type=A>
  <li>Does the continuous uniform distribution apply to either regular Oreo or double stuf Oreo cream filling masses? [AB0]</li>
  <li>Explain how you know. $hint1</li>
  [AB1]
  <li>Regular Oreos</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>What is the value of the `-2log(mathcal{L}(mu,sigma^2|mathcal{M}_{text{Reg}}))` for the fitted Normal? [AB2]</li>
    <li>Looking at the diagnostic plot for the fitted Normal, all of the points are [AB3] within the bounds.</li>
    <li>What is the value of the `-2log(mathcal{L}(mu,sigma|mathcal{M}_{text{Reg}}))` for the fitted Lognormal? [AB4]</li>
    <li>Looking at the diagnostic plot for the fitted Lognormal, all of the points are [AB5] within the bounds.</li>
    <li>Based upon the plot and the `-2Log(text{Likelihood})` values, [AB6] does a better job at describing the potential long-run behavior of cream filling mass for regular oreos.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Double Stuf Oreos</li>
    <ol type=i>
    <li>What is the value of the `-2log(mathcal{L}(mu,sigma^2|mathcal{M}_{text{DS}}))` for the fitted Normal? [AB7]</li>
    <li>Looking at the diagnostic plot for the fitted Normal, all of the points are [AB8] within the bounds.</li>
    <li>What is the value of the `-2log(mathcal{L}(mu,sigma|mathcal{M}_{text{DS}}))` for the fitted Lognormal? [AB9]</li>
    <li>Looking at the diagnostic plot for the fitted Lognormal, all of the points are [AB10] within the bounds.</li>
    <li>Based upon the plot and the `-2Log(text{Likelihood})` values, [AB11] does a better job at describing the potential long-run behavior of cream filling mass for double stuf oreos.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>[AB12]: Any fitted distribution that appears to describe the long run behavior of Oreo cream filling masss the best (i.e., small value of `-2Log(text{Likelihood})` and all points contained within the boundry) is the actual distribution of Oreo cream filling mass.</li>

<h2>Introduction to Permutation Simulations</h2>
<p>In the quest for finding the sampling distribution of size <em>N</em> for a statistic, say <em>J</em>, statisticians often turn to simulations to get around the high resource cost of actually replicating the second-order stochastic process an infinite number of times. One of the most useful of all simulation techniques is that of Permutation.</p>
<h4>The Core Logic of Permutation Simulations</h4>
<p>The core idea in Permutation Simulations is that our null hypothesis (i.e., our model of that matches the status quo) specifies that the groupings (by the value of the "Factor" attribute) of the data values (the "Response" attribute) have <strong><em>no statistically significant</em></strong> impact on the data values. Thus, we can think about group membership as being arbitrary. This arbitrary nature allows us to take a data value in one group and swap that value with another data value in the same or a different group <strong>without</strong> violating the null hypothesis. Since our sample has a total size of <em>N</em> with <em>k</em> groupings, there are finite number of unique permutations, `((N!),(n_1!*n_2!*ldots*n_k!))`. We can list out all of these permutations and calculate the value of our statistic for each one, thereby generating the exact permutation distribution of the statistic or we can use a Monte Carlo algorithm to get a sufficiently large sampling of these permutations to build an approximate permutation distribution.</p>
<h4>The General Steps of Carrying Out Permutation Simulations</h4>
<ol type=1>
  <li>Pose a Statistical Research Question (SRQ)</li>
  <li>Propose your null and alternative hypotheses; these are the models that could answer the SRQ. The Null Hypothesis does not always have to mean "no <em>statistical</em> difference"; the null hypothesis could represent the Status Quo or the currently accepted model for the phenomenon the SRQ deals with. This being said, Permutation Tests tend to be used with null hypotheses of the "no <em>statistical</em> difference" flavor.</li>
  <li>Choose a statistic, say <em>J</em>, that will help you look at the appropriate collection attribute so you can answer your SRQ.</li>
  <li>Design a second-order stochastic process (don't forget the first-order stochastic process) that you can use to answer your SRQ.</li>
  <li>Carry out your second-order stochastic process once. Calculate the obsvered value of <em>J</em>; call this <em>J*</em></li>
  <li>Under the null hypothesis, the group membership (or what treatment was applied) is arbitrary in accordance with the null model. This means that we are free to switch membership around. That is, we can permute (shuffle) the observed values between the treatment groups. The only thing we have to do is make sure there is same number of observations in each group as there were originally.</li>
  <li>Forming the Permutation Distribution</li>
  <ol type=a>
    <li><strong>Exact Permutation Distributions</strong></li>
    <ol type=i>
      <li>Form all possible unique permutations (combinations); that is, `((N!),(n_1!*n_2!*ldots*n_k!))=(N!)/(n_1!*n_2!*ldots*n_k!)` where `n_1+n_2+ldots+n_k=N` and there being <em>k</em> groups</li>
      <li>Calculate and record the value of <em>J</em> for each permutation</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>(Monte Carlo) Permutation Distributions</strong></li>
    <ol type=a>
      <li>Imagine assigning each possible permutation a unique ID and running a lottery where you select <em>m</em> permutations with/without replacement</li>
      <li>(Optional: picking a "random seed" to help with reproduciblity of results). Common values for <em>m</em> include 1000, 2500, 3600, and 10000.
      <li>For each of the <em>m</em> selected permutations, calculate and record the value of <em>J</em>.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Look through the exact/Monte Carlo Permutation Distribution to find the probability of getting a value of <em>J</em> that is as extreme or more so than your original value of <em>J</em>, <em>J*</em>. (Note: the meaning of "as extreme or more so" will depend upon your choice of null and alternative hypotheses.)
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>A Worked Example</h3>
<p>Suppose that we want to know whether computer-assisted instruction improves student performance on a particular test over traditional instruction. We use seven students and assign four of them to receive the computer-assisted instruction while the other three get traditional instruction. After the instruction period, all of the students take the same exam and we record the number of points they each received. Let `mathcal{C}=\{37,49,55,57\}` and `mathcal{T}=\{23,31,46\}` be the data for the computer-assisted and traditional, respectively. We will use the difference statistic `J(mathcal{C},mathcal{T})=SAM(mathcal{C})-SAM(mathcal{T})`. Since there are only `(7!)/(4!3!)=35` unique permutations, we will find an exact permutation distribution.</p>

<h2>JMP and Permutation Simulations</h2>
<p>JMP Pro allows you to conduct Monte Carlo-based permutation simulations. For small data sets, such as the prior example, JMP is NOT a good choice for getting an exact permutation distribution for any statistic. JMP Pro can give the exact permutation sampling distribution for a few specific statistics, via the Exact Tests menu. However, the following method will work for <em>any</em> statistic.</p>
<p>For this example you will need to download the <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/244/NTSA.CrashData.jmp">NTSA Crash Test Data file</a>. For more infomation on this data, see <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/Stories/CrashTestDummies.html">here</a> and <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/Datafiles/Crash.html">here</a>. The JMP file has been cleaned so do not get your file from these reference sites.</p>
<p>We want to know whether there is a difference in the load (pressure exerted upon) on the left femur of the crash test dummy based upon the size of the vehicle. (You will be using the columns marked L Leg and Size for this problem.) While there are 352 observations, 9 of them do not have data on the left femur load. Ignoring these, gives us 343 observations with the following frequency breakdown for Size: Comp--86, Hev--16, Lt--72, Med--60, Mini--13, MPV--32, Pu-34, and Van--30. This gives us a total number of unique permutations that is approximately 6.156728099388262129593811893625246801230887374142305...×10^276. Since trying to establish an exact permutation distribution of this size qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment, we will make use of JMP's Monte Carlo Permutation Simulation capabilities. Be sure to follow all of the instructions carefully.</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>In the space provided, write null and alternative hypothesis statements, pick a statistic to use (hint: look ahead), and describe a second-order stochastic process that you could use to get your initial data and value of the chosen statistic.</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>We will be using the F Ratio Statistic for this problem. Obtain the observed value of the F Ratio Statistic.</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>Open the NTSA Crash Test data file.</li>
    <li>Click on the Analyze menu and select Fit Y by X.</li>
    <li>Assign "L Leg" to "Y, Response", and "Size" to "X, Factor". Click OK.</li>
    <li>Click the Red Triangle next to "Oneway" and select "Means/Anova".</li>
    <li>In the "Analysis of Variance" box, there should a column labelled "F Ratio" this is our statistic. What is the value? [AB1]</li>
    <li>Leave this report window open for now.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Returning to the data table, we need to make a new column so that we can do the permutation simulation.</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>Click on the Cols menu and select "New Columns..."</li>
    <li>Name the new column "Switch".</li>
    <li>Under Column Properties, select "Formula"</li>
    <li>Under the Row menu, select "Col Stored Value".</li>
    <li>Click on "L Leg" to fill in the input box.</li>
    <li>Click your comma key to create a second input box.</li>
    <li>Under the Random menu, select "Col Shuffle"</li>
    <li>You should have something like this: $img1</li>
    <li>Press OK</li>
    <li>Set the location of the new column to "After last column". Press OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Return to the Oneway Report window and right-click on the F ratio value.</li>
  <li>Towards the bottom of the menu you should see "Simulate". Click on this value.</li>
  <li>Set "L Leg" as your column to Switch Out, set your number of samples to 2000, and set the random seed to 7. (The "Switch" column you just made should already be selected as your Switch In.)</li>
  <li>Press OK and wait for JMP to finish the permutation simulation.</li>
  <li>A new data table will appear and should have a script titled "Distribution" in the upper left corner. Look for the green play symbol and press the symbol.</li>
  <li>A new report window will open with three subfields (C. Total, Error, and Size). You can click the grey triangle next to the titles to collapse C. Total and Error.</li>
  <li>On the far right (or bottom if you are in vertical layout) you will find the simulation results.</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>What is the appropriate <em>p</em>-value for the hypothesis? [AB2] $note0</li>
    <li>Give the 95% confidence interval for the F Ratio: [AB3]</li>
  </ol>

  <li>In the space provided, write null and alternative hypothesis statements, pick a statistic to use (hint: look ahead), and describe a second-order stochastic process that you could use to get your initial data and value of the chosen statistic.</li>
  <h4>Answers will vary, but should be consistent with the following:</h4>
<p>The null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference in the load on the left femur due to the size of the vehicle. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistically significant difference in the load on the left femur for at least one vehicle size.</p>
<p>A second-order stochastic process would be as follows:</p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Starting with the 343 data values that we've already collected through a first-order stochastic process (getting vehicles, crashing them, and recording data from the dummies), we will calculate the value of the <em>F</em> ratio and record this value.</li>
<li>We will then select one vehicle's left femur load value and switch that load with another vehicle's value. The two vehicles will remain in their respective size categories, but their values of femur load will switch places.</li>
<li>Using this shuffled data, we will recalculate the value of the <em>F</em> ratio and record this new value.</li>
<li>We will repeat this shuffling process indefinitely</li>
</ol>
<h4>Grading Note</h4>
<p>Your response needed to include some mention of permutations or shuffling of data values. If you mentioned re-sampling, get all new cars, etc., you did not receive any points as these are <strong>not</strong> permutation simulation related processes.

<h2>Introduction to Bootstrap Simulations (Bootstrapping)</h2>
<p>Statistical inference centers around the question "How accurate are my data summaries (via descriptive statistics) for telling me about the long-run behavior (or the entire population)?" In order to answer this question, statisticians have to turn to the sampling distribution of size <em>N</em> for a statistic, say <em>J</em>. As mentioned in the Permutation Simulation section, replicating a second-order stochastic process is extremely resource intensive (including both time and money). To get around this issue, statisticians turn to using simulations. The Bootstrapping approach to simulation makes use of computational power of computers to produce measures of accuracy (e.g., biases, standardard errors, predicition errors) automatically, regardless of how complicated the rule of the statistic is. Bootstrapping is a re-sampling method where instead of re-sampling the population, we will treat our sample as our new population (pop' if you like).</p>
<h4>The Core Logic of Bootstrapping</h4>
<p>When you go to do a Boostrap Simulation, you have to start with the assumption that your original sample is representative of the population. $note1 Using this assumption, you can re-sample from your sample to build your bootstrap (sampling) distribtion for your statistic. The larger your initial sample is and the more bootstrap replications you do results in a better estimate for the actual sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for your statistic.</p>
<h4>The General Steps of Carrying Out Bootstraping</h4>
<ol type=1>
  <li>Pose a Statistical Research Question (SRQ)</li>
  <li>Propose your null and alternative hypotheses; these are the models that could answer the SRQ. The Null Hypothesis does not always have to mean "no <em>statistically significant</em> difference"; the null hypothesis could represent the Status Quo or the currently accepted model for the phenomenon the SRQ deals with. Bootstrap Tests work well with all types of hypotheses.</li>
  <li>Choose a statistic, say <em>J</em>, that will help you look at the appropriate collection attribute so you can answer your SRQ.</li>
  <li>Design a second-order stochastic process that you can use to answer your SRQ, making sure that your first-order stochastic process is designed well enough so that you are confident that you will get a representative sample.</li>
  <li>Carry out your second-order stochastic process once so that you havea sample of size <em>n</em>. Calculate the obsvered value of <em>J</em>; call this <em>J*</em></li>
  <li>Set up the Re-Sampling Frame</li>
  <ol type=a>
    <li>Since we are sampling from pop', we can make use of all of our sampling methods. The most common are variations of Simple Random Sampling and Stratified Random Sampling. Regardless of which method you use, you must ensure that you include these two restrictions: 1) all sampling is done WITH replacement (if you do without replacement, you will only reproduce your original sample) and 2) each bootstrap replicate (each new sample from pop') must be the same size as our original sample.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple Random Sample</strong></li>
    <ol type=i>
      <li>Assign each member of the sample a new ID and place all IDs into bin.</li>
      <li>Select one ID from the lottery and record the associated value of the attribute you got from the first-order stochastic process.</li>
      <li><strong>CRITICAL STEP:</strong> replace the ID into the bin and stir/shuffle/shake/etc.</li>
      <li>Repeat drawing out a single ID until you have <em>n</em> new recorded values.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Stratified Random Sample</strong></li>
    <ol type=i>
      <li>For each of the <em>k</em> layers, assign each member of the sample a new ID and place all IDs into the appropriate bin. You should have <em>k</em> bins.</li>
      <li>For Bin 1: Select one ID from the lottery and record the associated value of the attribute you got from the first-order stochastic process.</li>
      <li><strong>CRITICAL STEP:</strong> replace the ID into the bin and stir/shuffle/shake/etc.</li>
      <li>Repeat drawing out a single ID until you have <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> new recorded values. (<em>n<sub>i</sub></em> is the size of the sample for layer <em>i</em>)</li>
      <li>Repeat this method for each of the other bins until you have a total of <em>n</em> samples.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>For the new sample, calculate and record the value of <em>J'</em>. We use the prime notation to indicate that these values of <em>J</em> came from the bootstrap process rather than the original second-order stochastic process.</li>
  <li><strong>CRITICAL STEP:</strong> Repeat the Re-sampling process until you have <em>R</em> Bootstrap replicates. In general, the larger the value of <em>R</em>, the more accurate the bootstrap (sampling) distribution of <em>J</em> of size <em>n</em> will be. Common values of <em>R</em> are 10,000 and higher.</li>
  <li>From the recorded values of <em>J'</em>, form the bootstrap (sampling) distribution of <em>J</em> of size <em>n</em>.</li> 
  <li>Construct a 100(1-&alpha;)% Confidence Interval using either one of the following methods:</li>
  <ol type=a>
    <li><strong>Percentile Method:</strong> Give the interval that captures the middle 100(1-&alpha;)%. (In JMP, use the Quantile Results.)</li>
    <li><strong>Bias Corrected Percentile Method:</strong> Give the interval that covers the (1-&alpha;) proportion of outcomes. (In JMP, use the Bootsrap Confidence Limits results).</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Look for the value of <em>J</em> specified by your null hypothesis within your confidence interval to decide whether to accept (fail to reject) or reject your null hypothesis.</li>
</ol>
<h3>A Worked Example</h3>
<p>Suppose that we want to know whether computer-assisted instruction improves student performance on a particular test over traditional instruction. We use simple random sampling to select seven students from the whole population and assign four of them to receive the computer-assisted instruction while the other three get traditional instruction via the flip of a fair coin. After the instruction period, all of the students take the same exam and we record the number of points they each received. Let `mathcal{C}=\{37,49,55,57\}` and `mathcal{T}=\{23,31,46\}` be the data for the computer-assisted and traditional, respectively. We will use the difference statistic `J(mathcal{C},mathcal{T})=SAM(mathcal{T})-SAM(mathcal{C})`. The observed value of `J(mathcal{C},mathcal{T})=-16.1667`. $note0</p>
<p>We will assign each of the seven values unique IDS and draw out new samples, one at a time, build a group of four and then a second group of three. Using these new groups, we'll record the value of <em>J'</em>. We will repeat this whole process for a total of 10,000 replicates. The results appear below:</p>

<h2>JMP and Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>JMP Pro allows you to bootstrap many of the built-in statistics. With a bit of JSL (JMP Scripting Language), you can get JMP Pro to bootstrap other statistics. The JMP Add-In for this course includes scripting to bootstrap the ratio of two sample arithmetic means (which might come in handy when asked to find out whether or not something "double" is actually twice as much). While JMP Pro can perform bootstrapping, the algorithms are not as efficient as you would find in R or SAS. However, no matter how long JMP takes to do the bootstrap, JMP will always be faster than if you were to do the bootstrap by hand.</p>
<p>For this example you will need to download the <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/244/StatsInterest.jmp">Student Gender and Statistical Interest data file</a>. This file comes from the survey that many of you completed earlier this semester. To ensure uniformity of experience and results for all students, please use the version linked here rather than your own.</p>
<p>We want to know whether there is a difference in the level of interest in Statistics for female and male students using self-reported data. Given that the level of interest is on a Likert scale and has an ordinal modeling type, we cannot meaningfully combine data values. However, we can make use of the ordering to the data. Let us consider the difference statistic, <em>K</em> defined as `K(mathcal{M},mathcal{F})=Samptext{l}e\ Median(mathcal{M})-Samptext{l}e\ Median(mathcal{F})` where `mathcal{M}` and `mathcal{F}` represent the collection of levels of interest in Statistics for males and females, respectively.</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>In the space provided, write null and alternative hypothesis statements, pick a statistic to use (hint: re-read the last paragraph), and describe a second-order stochastic process that you could use to get your initial data and the observed value of the statistic.</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>Obtain the observed value of the difference statistic <em>K</em>.</li>
  <ol type=i>
    <li>Open the Student Gender and Statistical Interest data file.</li>
    <li>Click on the Analyze menu and select Fit Y by X.</li>
    <li>Assign the level of statistical interest to "Y, Response", and gender to "X, Factor". Click OK.</li>
    <li>Click the Red Triangle next to "Oneway" and select "Quantiles". $note0</li>
    <li>What is the observed value of <em>K</em>? [AB1]</li>
    <li>Leave this report window open for now.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Right-click on the [Sample] Median column in the Oneway Results window.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the menu you should see "Bootstrap". Click this option.</li>
  <li>Set the number of Bootstrap Samples (Replicates) to 10000 AND set the Random Seed to 213. Leave the other settings alone.</li>
  <li>Press OK and wait for JMP to finish bootstrapping.</li>
  <li>A new data table will appear and should have a script titled "Distribution" in the upper left corner as well as a message about what Random Seed you used. As you look at the data table, you'll see a column labelled "Female" and one labelled "Male". These are the values of `Samptext{l}e\ Median(mathcal{F})` and `Samptext{l}e\ Median(mathcal{M})`, respectively. Notice that there is no column for <em>K'</em>. Not to worry, just create a new column that calculates this value for you. Create a new column using the given definition for <em>K</em>. (I called my column K').</li>
  <li>Use the Analyze--Distribution platform and assign K' to the "Y, Columns" and press OK. You should see the standard distribution platform results plus an extra results section to the far right (or bottom) called "Bootstrap Confidence Limits". Notice that even though we bootstrapped the values of the <em>Sample Median</em> for the two groups, any function we define in that bootstrap table based upon those values, automatically inherents the bootstrapping.</li>
  <li>What is the 90% Percentile Method Confidence Interval for the values of <em>K'</em>? [AB2] $note1</li>
  <li>What is the 90% coverage Bias Corrected Confidence Interval? [AB3]</li>
  <li>What is the value of <em>K</em> that is specified by the null hypothesis? [AB4]</li>
  <li>Is this value in the 90% Percentile Method CI? [AB5]  What about the 90% coverage Bias Corrected CI? [AB6]</li>
  <li>When dealing with values that aren't continuous, such as the the difference in the values of the sample median of level of interest in Statistics, confidence intervals are trickier to deal with as they don't behave like we expect intervals to for the Reals. Notice that the value of 0 for <em>K'</em> extends from the 5%-tile all of the way to the 42.5%-tile. This indicates that even though 0 is the lower bound of an open interval, there are still zeros <em>within</em> the confidence interval. $note2</li>
  <li>Given what was just mentioned, should we conclude that at the 90% confidence level that there is a statistically significant difference between the level of interest in Statistics for males and females?</li>

<h2>Introduction to Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>
<p>I need to make a quick clarifying remark before delving into Monte Carlo Simulations. In the Permutation Simulations portion, you made use of Monte Carlo Permuation Simulations in place of Exact Permuation Simulation. This is not to say that you did a Monte Carlo Simulation. Rather, you made use of a Monte Carlo <em>Algorithm</em> while conducting a Permutation Simulation. This begs the question, what's the difference between a Monte Carlo Algorithm and a Monte Carlo Simulation? The difference comes down to how you're using the approach and for what purposes.</p>
<p>In general, a Monte Carlo Algorithm involves the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Define a complete sampling frame for the values of some attribute.</li>
    <li>Develop a method for picking units from that complete frame in as unbiased of a way as possible.</li>
    <li>Carry out your method and aggregate the results</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, this general layout sounds familiar. The layout matches that of the sampling methods we've discussed, with the expection that the sampling units are values of an attribute rather than objects. Tacitly, when you carry out a Monte Carlo Algorithm for Simple (or Stratified) Random Sampling, you're saying that the <em>choice</em> of a picking a value follows a discrete uniform distribution with <em>n</em> possible choices. For the Permutation case, the values are the unique permutations of the sample. For Bootstrapping, the values are the sampled values (no longer the original people). In both cases, we use the Monte Carlo Algorithm as means to carry out the permutations or the bootstrap.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo Simulations, on the other hand, have the goal of looking at the sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for the statistic <em>J</em> as directly as possible. Monte Carlo Simulations do not focus on choosing unique permutations or re-sampling; rather, these simulations focus on creating new "samples" by assuming that the attribute of interst follows a particular named distribution with specified parameters. We then generate <em>n</em> values from this specified distribution to be our new "sample" which we then use to find the value of our statistic <em>J</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main flavors of Monte Carlo Simulations. Both make assumptions about the named distribution stemming from the null hypothesis. The first type of Monte Carlo Simulation assumes that the attribute of interest in the first-order stochastic process follows a particular named distribution. This type of Monte Carlo Simulation is sometimes referred to as "Parametric Bootstrapping" as in essence, you are doing the exact samething as you would in bootstrapping. The only difference is that instead of re-sampling from your original sample, you are re-sampling from a named distribution. The second type of Monte Carlo Simulation assumes that the <em>statistic</em> follows a particular named distribution. You can then use the observed value of the statistic as the input to the distribution function to calculate <em>p</em>-values and construct confidence intervals. This second type of Monte Carlo simulations underpins most of the parametric "shortcut" methods that we use today.</p>
<h4>The Core Logic of Monte Carlo Simulations</h4>
<p>By assuming either the underlying attribute follows a particular distribution or the statistic follows a particular sampling distribution of size <em>n</em>, we provide ourselves with a named distribution from which we may draw new samples from (or values of the statistic) without 1) spending any more resources on replicating the original second-order stochastic process, and 2) use (potentially) computationally and time intensive methods to develop at permutation or bootstrap distributions. By assuming a particular distribution for the underlying attribute, we can make use of statistical theory to posit the sampling distribution for certain statistics (e.g., by using the Central Limit Theorem). Additionally, by assuming a particular sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for the statistic, we can make use of established calculus to shortcut the simulations altogether.</p>
<h4>The General Steps of Cararying Out Monte Carlo Simulations</h4>
<ol type=1>
  <li>Pose a Statistical Research Question (SRQ)</li>
  <li>Propose your null and alternative hypotheses; these are the models that could answer the SRQ. The Null Hypothesis does not always have to mean "no <em>statistical</em> difference"; the null hypothesis could represent the Status Quo or the currently accepted model for the phenomenon the SRQ deals with. Monte Carlo Tests can be used with all flavors of hypotheses.</li>
  <li>Choose a statistic, say <em>J</em>, that will help you look at the appropriate collection attribute so you can answer your SRQ.</li>
  <li>Design a second-order stochastic process that you can use to answer your SRQ, making sure that your first-order stochastic process is designed well enough so that you are confident that you will get a representative sample.</li>
  <li>Carry out your second-order stochastic process once so that you have a sample of size <em>n</em>. Calculate the obsvered value of <em>J</em>; call this <em>J*</em></li>
  <li>Monte Carlo Step</li>
  <ol type=a>
    <li><strong>First Type (Parametric Bootstrap)</strong></li>
    <ol type=i>
      <li>Using the null hypothesis, define the appropriate distribution for the base data.</li>
      <li>Using this distribution, generate a simulated sample of size <em>n</em>.</li>
      <li>Calculate and record the value of <em>J</em> for this simulated sample.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process indefinitely (or until you have a sufficiently large number of values of <em>J</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Second Type (On the Statistic)</strong></li>
    <ol type=i>
      <li>Using the null hypothesis, define the appropriate distribution for <em>J</em>.</li>
      <li>Using this distribution, generate and record a value.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process indefinitely.</li>
      <li>Use the above steps when the named distribution has an intractable distribution function. If there is a distribution function that you can use, skip the drawing of values and just use the distribution fuunction.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Use the sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for the statistic <em>J</em> to determine the probability of getting a value of <em>J</em> that is as extreme or more so than your original value, <em>J*</em>. (Note: the meaning of "as extreme or more so" will depend upon your choice of null and alternative hypotheses.)</li>
</ol> 
<h3>A Worked Example</h3>
<p>Suppose that we want to know whether computer-assisted instruction is different from traditional instruction for student achievement on a particular test. We use simple random sampling to select seven students from the whole population and assign four of them to receive the computer-assisted instruction while the other three get traditional instruction via the flip of a fair coin. After the instruction period, all of the students take the same exam and we record the number of points they each received. Let `mathcal{C}=\{37,49,55,57\}` and `mathcal{T}=\{23,31,46\}` be the data for the computer-assisted and traditional, respectively. We will use the difference statistic `J(mathcal{C},mathcal{T})=SAM(mathcal{T})-SAM(mathcal{C})`. The observed value of `J(mathcal{C},mathcal{T})=-16.1667`. $note0</p>
<p>Suppose that we assume that scores on this test follow a triangular distribution with minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 100 and a distribution mode of 55, regardless of which instructional method the test taker had. We will assign each of the seven values unique IDS and draw out new samples, one at a time, build a group of four and then a second group of three. Using these new groups, we'll record the value of <em>J'</em>. We will repeat this whole process for a total of 100,000 replicates. The results appear below:</p>

<h2>JMP and Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>
<p>Compared to Permutation Simulations and Bootstrapping, Monte Carlo Simulations are particularly easy in JMP (and you don't need to Pro version). All you need to do is create a new data table and define one or formula columns.</p>
<p>For this example you will not need any data.</p>
<p>We want to know whether adult men in the USA are taller than adult women living in the USA. For this study, "adult" was defined as 20 years old or older. Using a stratified random sampling method, we collected the heights of 50 men (`mathcal{M}`) and 50 women (`mathcal{W})`. Our difference statistic, <em>J</em> is defined as `J(mathcal{M},mathcal{W})=SAM(mathcal{M})-SAM(mathcal{W})`. Our observed value of the statistic is 4.9. We will assume that <em>J</em>⁓`mathcal{N}(0,0.510683)`.</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>In the space provided, write null and alternative hypothesis statements, pick a statistic to use (hint: re-read the last paragraph), and describe a second-order stochastic process that you could use to get your initial data and the observed value of the statistic.</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>What is the observed value of <em>J</em>? [AB1]</li>
  <li>Based upon the situation, which type of Monte Carlo Simulation are you going to do? [AB2]</li>
  <li>In JMP, create a new data table and title the first column "J".</li>
  <li>Right-click the column header and select "Formula...".</li>
  <li>Under the "Random" menu, find and click on "Random Normal".</li>
  <li>You should see "Random Normal()" appear in the formula definition space. By default, JMP assumes that you want a Standard Normal distribution. However, you can change that by double clicking on "Random Normal()" in the definition space (not the left pane) to enter the text editor version of the definition space.</li>
  <li>Place your cursor between the to parentheses and press your 0 key and then hit return. You should now see "Random Normal(0<sub>^</sub>)" in the definition space.</li>
  <li>Click once on the 0 and then press your comma key to get a second input box. Select the second input box and press the `root[y]{x}` button along the top of window. Enter 2 for `y` and the hypothesized value of the variance for `x`. (JMP looks for standard deviation rather than variance.) Click OK when finished.</li>
  <li>Click the Rows menu and select "Add Rows...". Enter in a sufficient large number of rows to add. Since we're trying to establish long-run behavior, think BIG (however, don't get carried away as your computer's memory can only handle so much). Click OK to populate your table.</li>
  <li>Bring up the Analyze-Distribution Platform and assign "J" to "Y, Columns".</li>
  <li>How should "as extreme or more so" be interpreted in this context?</li> 
  [AB3]
  <li>Based upon your last answer and the results of your simulation, what do you like the probability of getting a value of <em>J</em> as extreme or more so than we observed given the null hypothesis? [AB4]</li>
  <li>We cannot claim that the <em>p</em>-value is zero since we've made use of a simulation. However, if your results were like your instructor's, there were no values greater than 4, let alone greater than or equal to 4.9.</li>

<h2>Oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Screens-Confidence in Quantifying Risk</h2>
<p>In an experiment on decision making, researchers exposed various executive to one of three methods for quantifying the maximum risk the executive would be willing to pay to avoid uncertainty in making a business decision. The three methods were the Utility method, the Worry method, and the Comparison method. After using the assigned method, the researchers asked the executives to state his/her degree of confidence in the method on a scale of 0 (no confidence) to 20 (highest confidence).</p>
<p>Fifteen executives took part in the study and they were broken up into 5 age groups; the oldest three executives made the A1 group, the next oldest three made the A2 group, and so on until the three youngest executives formed group A5. One member within each age grouping was assigned to the Utility method by lottery, another member within the same group was assigned to the Worry method by lottery, and the third member was assigned the Comparison method.</p>
<p>The underlying question at hand is whether one of the risk quantification methods instills greater confidence than any of the others. To examine this we will want to make use of a Oneway ANOVA model to try to capture as much variation as we can for each different source of variation. For this particular situation we can identify three possible sources of variation in confidence:</p>
<ol type=1>
  <li><strong>The Age Grouping of the Executive:</strong> older individuals may be more catious than younger individuals. Individuals who are closer in age to each other tend to behave in more similar ways than individuals who have a greater discrepency in age.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantification Method Assigned:</strong> Different executives used different risk quantification methods and did not get to use any of the others. The relationship between change in quantification method and the change in confidence score is what the researcher ultimately want to explore.</li>
  <li><strong>The Executives:</strong> every person has had different past experiences, have different meanings, different feelings, different ways of thinking, and different ways of reacting. These differences (and plenty others not mentioned) make each individual executive a source of variation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular problem, we will ignore the age grouping and focus just on the quantification method assigned and the executives as our sources of variation. Recall, that for Oneway ANOVA, we will use the Treatment Effects Model (a.k.a. Factor Effects Model). Let <em>H</em> represent an executive's confidence score, &alpha;<sub>i</sub> represent the effect of an executive getting $indexi, let <em>j</em> index the executive (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) within a particular treatment and let &epsilon;<sub>ij</sub> represent the residual/error between the model and the observed value for individual <em>j</em> in treatment <em>i</em>. We'll define our model as </p>
<div align="center" style="font-size: 20pt;">`underbrace{h_{ij}}_{text{Data}}=underbrace{mu_{cdotcdot}}_{text{Screen 1}}+underbrace{alpha_{i}}_{text{Screen 2}}+underbrace{epsilon_{ij}}_{text{Residual Screen}}`</div>
<p>Notice that each portion of the model corresponds to a different screen. We will be filling in each screen as we go.</p>

<h2>Oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Screens-Confidence in Quantifying Risk w/Blocking</h2>
<p>In an experiment on decision making, researchers exposed various executive to one of three methods for quantifying the maximum risk the executive would be willing to pay to avoid uncertainty in making a business decision. The three methods were the Utility method, the Worry method, and the Comparison method. After using the assigned method, the researchers asked the executives to state his/her degree of confidence in the method on a scale of 0 (no confidence) to 20 (highest confidence).</p>
<p>Fifteen executives took part in the study and they were broken up into 5 age groups; the oldest three executives made the A1 group, the next oldest three made the A2 group, and so on until the three youngest executives formed group A5. One member within each age grouping was assigned to the Utility method by lottery, another member within the same group was assigned to the Worry method by lottery, and the third member was assigned the Comparison method.</p>
<p>The underlying question at hand is whether one of the risk quantification methods instills greater confidence than any of the others. To examine this we will want to make use of a Oneway ANOVA model to try to capture as much variation as we can for each different source of variation. For this particular situation we can identify three possible sources of variation in confidence:</p>
<ol type=1>
  <li><strong>The Age Grouping of the Executive:</strong> older individuals may be more catious than younger individuals. Individuals who are closer in age to each other tend to behave in more similar ways than individuals who have a greater discrepency in age.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantification Method Assigned:</strong> Different executives used different risk quantification methods and did not get to use any of the others. The relationship between change in quantification method and the change in confidence score is what the researcher ultimately want to explore.</li>
  <li><strong>The Executives:</strong> every person has had different past experiences, have different meanings, different feelings, different ways of thinking, and different ways of reacting. These differences (and plenty others not mentioned) make each individual executive a source of variation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular problem, we will include the variation due to the age grouping. However, our focus is still on the quantification method assigned and the executives as our sources of variation. Recall, that for Oneway ANOVA with Blocking, we will use the Treatment Effects Model (a.k.a. Factor Effects Model). Let <em>H</em> represent an executive's confidence score, &alpha;<sub>i</sub> represent the effect of an executive getting $indexi, &beta;<sub>j</sub> represent the effect of an executive being in $indexj, let <em>k</em> index the executive within a particular pairing of treatment and block ($indexk), and let &epsilon;<sub>ijk</sub> represent the residual/error between the model and the observed value for individual <em>k</em> in block <em>j</em> receiving treatment <em>i</em>. We'll define our model as </p>
<div align="center" style="font-size: 20pt;">`underbrace{h_{ijk}}_{text{Data}}=underbrace{mu_{cdotcdotcdot}}_{text{Screen 1}}+underbrace{beta_{j}}_{text{Screen 2}}+underbrace{alpha_{i}}_{text{Screen 3}}+underbrace{epsilon_{ijk}}_{text{Residual Screen}}`</div>
<p>Notice that each portion of the model corresponds to a different screen. We will be filling in each screen as we go.</p>

<p>In Unit 2 we developed the notion of distribution for the pairing of a [first-order] stochasic process and an attribute of objects/living beings (shorthand phrase: "distribution of the stochastic variable"). Now in Unit 4, we've extended the idea of distribution to looking at pairings of a second-order stochastic process and a statistic/estimator. This extendend concept is what we refer to as a "sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for the statistic/estimator <em>J</em>".</p>
<p>Why do we need to have a second-order stochastic process? Why can't we just use the first-order stochastic process?<p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>We need a second-order process as we're trying to understand the long-run behavior of an attribute of a collection. The first-order process will only let us examine the behavior of attributes of individual objects/beings. To move up a level to the attribute of collections, we must carry out a higher-order process.</p>

<p>What is the importance of specifying <em>n</em> for sampling distributions?<p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>We have to specify <em>n</em> so that we know how many times we're carrying out the first-order stochastic process. This results in setting which size of collection we're looking at. Even though we may use a statistic that already accounts for the size of the collection (e.g., <em>SAM</em> or <em>SGM</em>), these statistics can (and do) have different long-run behaviors for different sized collections.</p>

<p>Explain how Permutation, Bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo similations differ from each other.</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>While all three (four) are simulation methods for getting at the sampling distribution of size <em>n</em> for a statistic/estimator <em>J</em>, they differ in how the simulations are carried out. Permutation simulations assume that we can shuffled the observations between groups. By looking at all of the permutations of the observations, we can arrive at exact <em>p</em> values. Bootstrapping assumes that our sample is representative of the population and we re-sample with replacement from the sample. For Monte Carlo, we make assumptions about our data or our statistic following a specific distribution and then sample from those distributions.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>A <em>p</em>-value is the probability that we get a value of the statistic/estimator just as extreme or more so than what we actually observed under the null hypothesis/model. This value, in conjunction with our threshold of unusualness, helps us decide with hypothesis our data is more compatible with.</p>

<h3>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p><strong>The same interpretation works for both.</strong></p>
<p>If we were to repeat the second-order stochastic process indefinitely, constructing confidence intervals in the exact same way each time, then 90% of those intervals will contain the true value of the parameter that the statistic <em>J</em> (or <em>K</em>) is an estimator for.</p>

<h2>Oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Screens-Confidence in Quantifying Risk Conclusion</h2>
<h4>You should complete the two prior questions before continuing with this question.</h4>
<p>In using the ANOVA Screens, we've passed the data through 2 (or 3 with blocking) screens to capture as much of the occuring variation as possible. Each screen captures some amount of variation and attributes that variation to some source. We used the <em>Sum of Squares</em> statistic (properly <em>Sum of Square Deviations from [insert reference point]</em>) to measure the amount of variation at each screen. Three questions come to mind 1) "Why is this called Analysis of Variance", 2) "What do we we do with these <em>SSQ</em> measures?", and 3) "Why did we need those "<em>Degrees of Freedom</em>" values?"</p>
<p>Recall from Unit 3, that we used the value of <em>Degrees of Freedom</em> with the <em>Sum of Square Deviations from the Sample Arithmetic Mean</em> statistic to allow us to compare the amount of Variation as Deviation in one collection with the amount of Variation as Deviation in another collection, even when the two collections have different Sizes. We want to do something similar here. However, instead of comparing the collection of confidence scores to entirely new collection of confidence scores, we will compare the collection of treatment effects to the collection of errors/residuals; when you have blocking you also compare the collection of block effects to the collection of errors. For the collection of treatment effects, the size is 3 while the size of the collection of errors/residuals is 15 (for the collection of block effects the size is 5). However, since we put additional constraints on our model (treatment effects must add to zero, block effects must add to zero, and the residuals must add to zero), we have to make adjustments to the size of each collection; this adjustment given by <em>Degrees of Freedom</em>. By dividing the value of <em>SSQ</em> by the associated value of the <em>Degrees of Freedom</em> allows us to make the comparisons between the collections that we want. This answers question 3 and gives a partial ansewr to question 2 (more to come).</p>
<p>Although the null hypothesis for an Oneway ANOVA model (with or without Blocking) is that all of the treatment effects are the same, we only use the treatment effects to get a measure of variation as deviation. Each screen can be thought to capture a different type of variation.</p> 
 <ul>
    <li>The <em>GSAM</em> Screen captures some of the Variation Between Collections (VBC)</li>
    <li>The Blocks and Treatment Screens both capture Variation Between Collections (VBC) as well as Variation Between Individuals Within a Collection(VBI/VWC)</li>
    <li>The Residual Screen captures Variation Within Individuals (VWI) (plus any other variation that we didn't capture through another screen).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the treatment effects are the same then the VBC+VBI/VWC captured by the treatment screen should be the same as the VWI+ captured by the residual screen. By comparing measures of variation as deviation, we can test our null hypothesis model. Hence the name "Analysis of Variance" (and the answer to question 1).</p>
<p>Hopefully, by this time you have a gut instinct for how we're going to compare our adjusted <em>SSQ</em> values. The following questions will finish the answer to question 2.</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>Adjusting <em>SSQ</em> Values</li>
  <ol type=1>
    <li>What operation should you use to adjust each value of <em>SSQ</em> by the value of the associated <em>Degrees of Freedom</em>? [AB0] </li>
    <li>The statistic formed by doing the adjustment is called a "<em>Mean Square</em>" (<em>MS</em>). Give the value of each of the following:</li>
    <ul type=disc>
      <li>Oneway ANOVA <strong>without</strong> Blocking</li>

    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li>Which of the following makes the most sense to define as a statistic to compare the measures of variation? [AB6]</li>
  <li>Under the null hypothesis, what should be the value of this statistic? [AB7]</li>
  <li>Compute the value of this statistic for each of the following:</li>

<h3>Oreo Data</h3>
<h4>$warning</h4>
<p>You were asked to anwser the following statistical research question:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Are Double Stuf Oreos really double the stuf?</strong></p>
<p>Keeping in mind that "stuf" refers to the creme filling of an Oreo, we can think about this question as representing the following mathematical expression: `\text{E}[X_{\text{D}}]=2\text{E}[X_{\text{R}}]` where <em>X</em> represents the mass of creme filling (in grams) of Oreos and the subscripts D and R signifying the type of Oreo (Double stuf or Regular, respectively).</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>Using this information and $note0 as your estimator for the expected value for creme filling, write an appropriate alternative hypothesis.</li>
  [AB0] $note1 $previewloc[0]
  <li>Now write the appropriate null hypothesis.</li>
  [AB1]
  <li>The hypotheses have given you the general form of the estimator we'll use to answer the SRQ. However, you still need to select which statistic you will use as `hat{mu_D}` and `hat{mu_R}`.

<p>Regardless of what you chose in the prior problem, in this problem we will use the <em>sample arithmetic mean</em> as our estimator for the expected value of creme filling. When we use the permutation method of simulation, we are checking whether or not there is a difference between the two groups. Thus we will investigate the new hypotheses: $HS0 vs $HS1.</p>
<p>Mondel&#275;z International, Inc. (the company that owns Oreos), has asked you to answer the SRQ using the data that you and your group collected.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary but should be consistent with the following</h3>
<p>The second-order stochastic process in this situation would entail the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a package of regular and a package of double stuf oreos via two separate lottery systems.</li>
<li>Weigh the mass (g) of creme filling for each cookie for both types of oreo. Record these values.</li>

<h2>Airline Holding Times</h2>
<p>An airline has a toll-free number that potential customers can call to make flight reservations. Usually, the call volume is heavy and callers are placed on hold until an agent is free to answer. The airline hopes that a caller remains on the line until the call is answered.</p>
<p>The airline has three recordings that they can play while the caller is on hold: the airline's current advertisements and promotions, Muzak (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJWZxPW45c" target=_new>"elevator music"</a>), or classical music (specificially, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA" target=_new>Vivaldi's <em>Four Seasons</em></a>). The airline has hired you to assist with deciding what recording they should play.</p>
<h4>Recap</h4>
<p>Thus far, you're investigating the SRQ "What recording keeps callers on the longest?" using an ANOVA model, an <em>F</em> ratio, with EER = 0.05. At this point in time you will now use ANOVA Screens to help you analyze the data collected.</p>

<h3>Corn Varieties and Crop Yield</h3>
<p><strong><em>Change your browser window so that width of the window is much longer than the height. This will improve how the question looks.</em></strong></p>
<p>In science, a well-designed experiment is not just desirable but mandatory if you want to say anything useful about what you're studying. When we have well-designed experiments, we are able to tease apart our data into components where each component speaks to the theory we're working with/on. In Statistics, the teasing apart of our data occurs with the idea of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Screen. We imagine passing our data through a series of screens, each of which will "caputure" the part of each data value associated with that screen's component of the theory.</p>
<p>Argiculturalist often what to maximize crop yields for a given field size. Different species of the same crop produce differing amounts of product. Corn is one crop that has a variety of usages. Reseachers designed an experiment to examine crop yields (in bushels per acre) for four different species of corn. The data are available $dataFile.</p>
<p>Using the idea of ANOVA screens to fill out the following tables and determine whether there is a difference in crop yields for the corn varieties. For the tables, give decimals to two places.</p>

<h3>Barley Varieties, Choice of Field, and Crop Yield</h3>
<p><strong><em>Change your browser window so that width of the window is much longer than the height. This will improve how the question looks.</em></strong></p>
<p>Suppose that you're an agronommist trying to decide which variety of barely is the best. You've defined "best" as having a high yield so that farmers can make the most profit for a fixed field area. The yield of crops is measured in bushels per acre. To minimize the impact of differences in fields (F1-4), you use a blocking design for four vareities of barely (V1-4) and grow one crop of each. The data are available $dataFile</p>
<p>Using the idea of ANOVA screens to fill out the following tables and determine whether there is one vareity of barley that is better than the others. For the tables, give decimals to two places.</p>

<h2>Corn Varieties and Crop Yield: Oneway ANOVA + Post Hoc</h2>
<h3>Part 3 of 3</h3>
<p>Argiculturalists often want to maximize crop yields for a given field size. Different species of the same crop produce differing amounts of product. This is especially true for corn, which has usages ranging from cattle feed to food stuffs, beverages to fuel (ethanol). Reseachers designed an experiment to examine crop yields (in bushels per acre) for four different species of corn. The data are available $datafile.</p>
<p>On this page, you will write up a conclusion to the test.</p>
<p>The results from the prior page appear below for your convenience; recall that your `alpha_{UT}=$UT`.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary and depend upon your selected threshold of unusualness: $UT</h3>
<h4>If your `alpha_{UT}&lt;0.0188`, then...</h4>
<p>There is no statistically significant difference in corn yield due to the corn variety.</p>
<h4>If your `0.0188&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.1122`, then...</h4>
<p>There does appear to be a statistically significant difference in corn yield due to corn variety (`F_{3,12}=$key[0]`, <em>p</em> = $key[5]). Corn variety has a large effect on yield (`eta^2=$key[6]`, `omega^2=$key[7]`). There is only one pair of varieties that are statistically different: popcorn and flint (diff = $key[8], <em>p</em> = $key[9]). The difference here is large (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[10]) with popcorn's yield beating flint's yield ~$key[11]% of the time we would repeat the experiment.</p>
<h4>If your `0.1122&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.1369`, then...</h4>
<p>There does appear to be a statistically significant difference in corn yield due to corn variety (`F_{3,12}=$key[0]`, <em>p</em> = $key[5]). Corn variety has a large effect on yield (`eta^2=$key[6]`, `omega^2=$key[7]`). There are two pairs of varieties that are statistically different: popcorn vs. flint (diff = $key[8], <em>p</em> = $key[9]), and sweet corn vs. flint (diff = $key[12], <em>p</em> = $key[13]). The difference is large for popcorn vs. flint (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[10]) with popcorn's yield beating flint's yield ~$key[11]% of the time we would repeat the experiment. Similarly, there is a large difference in yield for sweet corn and flint corn (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[14]); sweet corn's yield beats flint corn's yield ~$key[15]% of the time.</p>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary and depend upon your selected threshold of unusualness: $UT</h3>
<h4>If your `alpha_{UT}&lt;0.0090`, then...</h4>
<p>There is no statistically significant difference in HBE levels due to the exercise program.</p>
<h4>If your `0.0090&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;=0.15`, then...</h4>
<p>There does appear to be a statistically significant difference HBE levels due to the exercise program (`t_{$key[1]}=$key[0]`, <em>p</em> = $key[2]). There is a large effect showing that HBE is lower in May than in January (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[4]); in only ~$key[5]% of of all replications of the experiment would we expected to see an individual with higher HBE levels in May than in January.</p>
<h4>OR</h4>
<p>There is a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level as zero is outside of the confidence interval $key[3]</p>

<h2>UNL Heights: One Sample <em>Z</em></h2>
<h3>Part 3 of 3</h3>
<p>In a large scale study, researchers found that the height of US adult (20+ y.o.) women follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution with an Expected Value of 65 inches and a Variance of 12.25 squared inches. An undergraduate at the University of Nebraska used a simple random sample of students, staff, and faculty at UNL to select 30 women, all of whom agreed to have their heights measured. The data are available $datafile. The undergraduate wants to know whether or not her sample is representative given what research has established about the height of US adult women's heights.</p>
<p>The results from the prior page appear below for your convenience; recall that your `alpha_{UT}=$UT`.</p>
<h3>$warning</h3>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>`Z=$values[0]`,  <em>p</em>-value = $values[1], 95% CI: `$values[2]`, Cohen's `d=$values[3]`</p>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary and depend upon your selected threshold of unusualness: $UT</h3>
<h4>If your `alpha_{UT}&lt;0.0078`, then...</h4>
<p>The sample is not statistically unusual from our theory.</p>
<h4>If your `0.0078&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.15`, then...</h4>
<p>The sample of US adult women's heights is statistically unusual given the theory (<em>Z</em> = $key[0], <em>p</em> = $key[1]). There is a small difference between our sample's heights and the prevailing theory (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[3]).</p>
<h4>OR</h4>
<p>The sample is statistically unusual given our theory at the 95% confidence level as 65 is not in the confidence interval $key[2].</p>

<h3>Dendritic Trees</h3>
<p>A dendritic tree is a branched structure that emanates from the body of a nerve cell. In a study of brain development, researchers examined brain tissue from seven adult guinea pigs. The researchers selected nerve cells from a certain region of the brain and counted the number of dendritic branch segments emanating from each selected cell. The researchers repeated this process a total of 36 times; their data is available <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/180/DendriticTrees.jmp">here</a></p>
<p>Alberto, the lead researcher, believes that the number of dendritic branches is Gaussian distributed with an Expected Value of 38 and a Variance of 10. Alberto: "Does our sample fit within what our theory suggests?"</p>

<p>Given that the theory specifically states that the Normal distribution is what is given, the <em>Z</em> test is most appropriate.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Alberto, given the data we can state that your sample is statistically unusual for the given theory on adult guinea pig's number of dendritic branches (`Z=$Z[0]`, `p $Z[1]`).

<h3>Skin Ulcers</h3>
<p>A group of medical centers banded togeter to test a new drug, Dermotel, for accelerating the healing of dermal foot ulcers in diabetic patients. Each of the four medical centers had a different number of patients involved in the study, but within each center the reseachers attempted to put a similar number of patients into each treatment. The researchers used a lottery system to assign willing patients to either receive Dermotel or sodium hyaluronate (HA), which is the standard method of treating skin ulcers. The researcher measured the surface are of the ulcers throughout the experiment. At the conclusion of the data collection period (20 weeks), the researchers classified any patient whose ulcer had shrunk by at least 90% as a "Responder".

<p>where `ccF` represents the collection of fertilized radish heights and `ccC` represents the collection of unfertilized radish heights.
<p>Given that the heights appear to be normally distributed (via quantile plot), we can make use of Welch's <em>t</em>. This works particularly well since we have a directional alternative hypothesis. JMP only gives us two-tail hypothesis for Wilcoxon Rank Sum, which is a different question.</p>

<h3>Beef Steers</h3>
<p>In an experiment to compare two diets for fattening beef steers, Florence matched nine pairs of animals from a herd. The members of each steer pair had the same values for every attribute with regards to hereditary and biological factors. Florence used a fair coin flip to assign one steer from each pair to one diet; the other steer received the other diet. She weighed each steer twice; at the start of the experiment and at the end of the experiment, 140 days later. The weight gain data is available <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/180/BeefSteers.jmp">here</a>. </p>
<p>Florence: "Is one diet better than the other?"</p>

<h3>Muscle Metabolism</h3>
<p>For a study looking at the effect of caffiene on muscle metabolism, nine male volunteers underwent arm exercise tests on two separate occassions. On one occasion, the volunteer took a placebo capsule an hour before the test; on the other occassion, he received a capsule containing pure caffeine. (The researchers flipped a fair coin to determine the order that a volunteer got the capsules.) During each exercise test, the researchers measured the volunteer's respiratory exchange ratio (RER) as a percentage. The RER is the ratio of carbon dioxide produced with respect to the oxygen consumed; this ratio is an indicator of whether energy is coming from carbohydrates or fats. Values of RER of 1.00 or above indicate that carbohydrates are the primary energy source, values around 0.85 indicate a mix of fat and carbohydrates as the fuel, and values of 0.7 or lower indicate that fact is the dominate source. The data is available <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/180/MuscleMetabolism.jmp">here</a>. </p>
<p>Gordon: "Does caffiene affect muscle metabolism?"</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Gordon, there appears to be a large difference between RER for caffeine and placebo treatments (`t_{MP}($t[1])=$t[0]`,`p=$t[2]`); caffeine treatments have a lower RER than the placebo treatments (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = `$t[4]`). In fact, if you were to repeat the experiment indefinitely, in only $ps% of the volunteers will the RER be higher for the caffeine treatment.</p>

<h3>Coronary Artery Disease</h3>
<p>Medical research doctors used a chance process to assign volunteer patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) to either receive angioplasty and medical therapy (`n_1=1149`) or just medical therapy (`n_2=1138`)in a clinical trial. Over the next several years, 85 of the angioplasty+ and 95 medical therapy only patients died, with the cause of death categorized as "cardiac", "other", or "unknown". The data for these patients' death is available <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/180/CoronaryArtery.jmp">here</a>. </p>

<li><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>: `Samptext{l}e\ Median(ccH)-Samptext{l}e\ Median(ccN)&gt;0`</li>
</ul>
<p>Isaac and Joyce, there is a statistically significant difference in MBF values under the two conditions (`S=$WRS[0]`, `p=$WRS[1]`).

<h3>Monoamine Oxidase and Schizophrenia</h3>
<p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that is thought to play a role in the regulation of behavior. To see whether different categories of schizophrenic patients have different levels of MAO activity, researchers collected blood specimens from 42 patients and measured the MAO activity in the platelets. The data consist of MAO activity measured in nmol of benzyladehyde product per 10<sup>8</sup> platelets per hour and schizophrenic diagnosis; data are available <a href="https://imathas.rationalreasoning.net/course/files/180/MonoamineOxidase.jmp">here</a>.</p>
<p>One the researchers, Kirk, informs you that Diagnosis I refers to patients who are chronic-undifferentiated schizophrenics; Diagnosis II refers to patients who are undifferentiated with paranoid features; Diagnosis III refers to patients who are paranoid schizophrenics. Kirk: "Is there a difference in MAO activity due to diagnosis?"</p>

<p>Since each row represents a unique patient and Kirk did not mention that any of the patients were related, we can assume that Independence is met.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Kirk, there does appear to be a statistically significant difference in MAO levels due to schizophrenia diagnosis  (`F($anova[1],$anova[2])=$anova[0]`, `p=$anova[3]`). The diagnosis accounts for around $prop % of the variation in MAO levels.

<h3>Test Selection</h3>
<p>Our threshold of unusualness shall be `alpha_{UT}=0.05`.</p>
<p>You could use Permutation, Bootstrapping, ANOVA <em>F</em> test, or ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test. Your hypotheses are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><em>H</em><sub>0</sub>: `tau_{P1}=tau_{P2}=tau_{P3}=tau_{C}`</li>
<li><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>: Not <em>H</em><sub>0</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>where subscripts indicate the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Since each row represents a unique sample, we can assume that Independence is met. From the quantile plot, the CFU counts do not appear to be normally distributed. Additionally, we have heteroscedasticity as indicated by the megaphone shape in the upper dot plot on the left. If we were to do a log transformation of the data, we might be able to get the data to be normally distributed and homoscedastic. However, as evidenced by the lower-left dot plot, we still have an issue with different variances. We should proceed with the ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Leslie, there does appear to be a statistically significant difference in the number of CFUs based upon which treatment was applied (`H_{$kw[1]}=$kw[0]`, `p=$kw[2]`). The preservative accounts for around $prop % of the variation in CFU counts.</p>
<p>At the 95% confidence level, Preservative 2 is statistically different from Preservative 1 (`Z=$sd[1]`, `p=$sd[2]`). The CFU counts for Preservative 2 are higher than Preservative 1 to large extent (`hat{Delta}=$sd[3]`, <em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $sd[4]). If you were to indefinitely repeat the comparison between Preservatives 2 and 1, Preservative 2 would have the higher CFU count $ps[0]% of the time. Preservative 3 is statistically different from Preservative 2 (`Z=$sd[36]`, `p=$sd[37]`). The CFU counts for Preservative 3 are lower than Preservative 2 to large extent (`hat{Delta}=$sd[38]`, <em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $sd[39]). If you were to indefinitely repeat the comparison between Preservatives 3 and 2, Preservative 3 would have the higher CFU count $ps[5]% of the time.</p>

SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary and depend upon your selected threshold of unusualness: $UT</h3>
<h4>If your `alpha_{UT}&lt;0.0168`, then...</h4>
<p>There is no statistically significant difference in corn yield due to the corn variety.</p>
<h4>If your `0.0168&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.1331`, then...</h4>
<p>There does appear to be a statistically significant difference in corn yield due to corn variety (`H_{3}=$key[0]`, <em>p</em> = $key[1]). Corn variety has a large effect on yield (`eta^2=$key[2]`, `epsilon^2=$key[3]`). However, there are no pairs that are statistically different from one another. This suggests that further research needs to be conducted with careful examination of the experiment's methods.</p>
<h4>If your `0.1331&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.15`, then...</h4>
<p>There does appear to be a statistically significant difference in corn yield due to corn variety (`H_{3}=$key[0]`, <em>p</em> = $key[1]). Corn variety has a large effect on yield (`eta^2=$key[2]`, `epsilon^2=$key[3]`). There are three pairs of varieties that are statistically different: popcorn vs. flint (<em>Z</em> = $key[4], <em>p</em> = $key[5]), sweet vs. flint (<em>Z</em> = $key[9], <em>p</em> = $key[10]), and popcorn vs. dent (<em>Z</em> = $key[14], <em>p</em> = $key[15]). The difference is large for popcorn vs. flint (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[7]) with popcorn's yield beating flint's yield ~$key[8]% of the time we would repeat the experiment. The median difference between popcorn yields and dent yields is $key[6] bushels per acre. There is a large difference in yield for sweet corn and flint corn (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[12]); sweet corn's yield beats flint corn's yield ~$key[13]% of the time; here the median difference in yield is $key[11] bushels per acre. Popcorn yields beat dent yields with a median improvement of $key[16] bushels per acre; this indicates that ~$key[18]% of time we repeat popcorn has a higher yield than dent corn. This difference is large (<em>d</em><sub>Cohen's</sub> = $key[17])</p>

<h2>Butterfly Wing Area: Wilcoxon Signed Rank</h2>
<h3>Part 3 of 3</h3>
<p>As part of a larger study of body composition, researchers captured 14 male Monarch butterflies at Oceano Dunes State Park in California and measured wing area (in square centimeters). From prior studies the researchers are certain that male Monarch butterfly window area follows a continuous distribution with a location parameter value of 30.5 sq. cm. The data are available $datafile. We will let `theta` represent the location parameter.</p>
<p>On this page, you will write up a conclusion to the test.</p>
<p>The results from the prior page appear below for your convenience; recall that your `alpha_{UT}=$UT`.</p>
<h3>$warning</h3>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p><em>S</em> = $values[0], <em>df</em> = $values[1], <em>p</em>-value = $values[2]</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<h3>Answers will vary and depend upon your selected threshold of unusualness: $UT</h3>
<h4>If your `alpha_{UT}&lt;0.0055`, then...</h4>
<p>The sample is not statistically unusual from our theory.</p>
<h4>If your `0.0055&lt;=alpha_{UT}&lt;0.15`, then...</h4>
<p>The sample of male Monarch butterflies does appear to be statistically different from what we expect (<em>S</em> = $key[0], <em>p</em> = $key[2]).</p>

<h3>Paper vs. Computerized Tests</h3>
<p>This semester we have a unique opportunity related to tests. As you know from the syllabus, we have two tests and a final exam for this course. There are several ways that the two tests can taken:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Person, Paper Based: everyone comes to class and you take the exam that has been printed on paper. You will be proctored by the instructor and additional staff.</li>
  <li>In Person, Computerized: everyone comes to class, you bring your computer, and you take a computerized exam. You will be proctored by the instructor and additional staff.</li>
  <li>At Home, Computerized: during the testing window you log into system to take a computerized exam. You will be proctored using a remote proctoring service, RPNow. </li>
</ul>
<p>The test will consist of the same questions whether printed on paper or computerized. Additionally, you will be proctored while you take the exam whether in person or at home. This question is meant to start a dialog to gather what students might like. <strong>The results of this question are not binding; the actual format/delivery of the tests will be announced closer to the actual test date.</strong></p>
<p>Which test format and delivery method do you currently prefer?</p>

<h3>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following:</h3>
<ol type=A>
  <li>How would you explain a <strong>Quantity</strong> to another person? Provide at least two examples.</li>
  <h4>A quantity is any specific attribute that we imagine measuring to get the value of for any object or living being. Examples include height, mass, weight, age, number of siblings, position on the Earth, etc. </h4>
  <li>How would you explain a <strong>Quality</strong> to another person? Provide at least two examples.</li>
  <h4>A quality is any specific attribute that is non-measurable but observable and whose values we can categorize. Examples include sex, eye color, color, shape, gender, blood type, etc.</h4>
  <li>How would you explain an <strong>Intangible Attribute</strong> to another person? Provide at least two examples.</li>
  <h4>An intangible attribute is any specific attribute that cannot be directly measured nor observed. Rather we infer the value of intangible attributes through the values of other quantities and qualities. Examples include intelligence, physical fitness, resiliency, health, etc.</h4>

<p>How would you explain <strong>Variation Within an Individual</strong> to another person? Provide at least two examples of this type of variation.</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<p>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following:</p>
<h4>Variation within an individual refers to the changing of a value of an attribute (or values of multiple attributes) of the same object or living being typically due to the passage of time. For example, every living thing starts life with some amount of mass. As we all grow older, the value of mass for each living thing changes, increasing and decreasing. As a second example, as I move through the week, the style of shoe that I'm wearing at any moment in time changes: I might start of with "no shoes" and then the value might change to "slippers", followed by the value "tennis shoes".</h4>

<p>How would you explain <strong>Variation Between Individuals/Variation Within a Collection</strong> to another person? Provide at least two examples of this type of variation.</p>
[AB]

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<p>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following:</p>
<h4>Variation Between Individuals/Variation Within a Collection refers to the changing of a value of an attribute (or values of multiple attributes) as we shift our focus from one member of a collection to another member of the same collection. We imagine each individual object or living being as frozen in time (thus variation within an individual is at the back of our minds) and the "change" in attribute value is no longer due to the passage of time but rather us looking at a different object or being. For example, if we were to gather 100 mineral samples, we would see Variation Between Individual rocks (Within our collection) as we shift our attention for Rock 1 to Rock 2 to Rock 3. As we shift our attention, we could be looking at the attribute of color, the attribute of hardness, or even the attribute of taste. A second example could be found by looking at all ASU students; as we shift our attention from student to student, we could see a change in the value of the attribute of year in school or major.</h4>

ANSWER


SOLUTION
<p>Answers may vary but should be consistent with the following:</p>
<h4>Variation Between Collections refers to the changing of a value of an attribute of a collection as we shift our attention from one collection to another collection. An example of this kind of variation would be comparing how many people make up two separate collections; suppose we look at the collections of Neil's Brief Calculus class and Neil's Elements of Statistics class. These collections both have the attribute "size" and as we move from one collection to the other, the value of that attribute changes from 95 (calculus) to 70 (stats).</h4>

<h2>Continuous Uniform Distributions</h2>
<p>When a continuous stochastic variable has the behavior that the cumulative long-run relative frequency (i.e., the cumulative probability) is proportional to the value of the stochastic variable, we say that the stochastic variable has a Continuous Uniform distribution. As brief reminder, we will want to think about continuous as being able to constantly zoom in on two adjacent values and find even more values between them.</p>

<h2>Continuous Uniform Distributions</h2>
<p>When a continuous stochastic variable has the behavior that the cumulative long-run relative frequency (i.e., the cumulative probablity) is porportional to the value of the stochastic variable, we say that the stochastic variable has a Continuous Uniform disribution. As brief reminder, we will want to think about continuous as being able to constantly zoom in on two adjacent values and find even more values between them.</p>
<p>In these types of situations, we assume that the stochastic variable can taken on any value between (and including) the lower and upper bounds, `a` and `b`, respectively. This is to say that if we let `X` represent our stochastic variable, then `a le X le b`. The hallmark of a continuous uniform situation is that we assume that the accumulation of outcomes occurs are a constant rate of change (RoC).</p>
<h4>Distribution Shorthand</h4>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the continuous uniform situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Continuous Uniform Distribuiton over the closed interval `[a,b]`.

<h2>Normal (Gaussian) Distributions</h2>
<p>When we are dealing with whole populations (i.e., that aren't sub-set by certain special features like an illness) and we are looking at a stochastic variable whose values are continuous, we have a strong possibility of having a $note0 situation. When we consider the heights of human adults, the situation is often a normal situation.  The theory around normal situations is well developed.  This has lead to the development of "standardization" (or "normalization") techniques so that researchers can make use of the theory behind normal situations.  In terms of practice, histograms that are symmetric and bell-shaped are typically (but not always) associated with normal distributions.  Finally, we can often approximate the long-run behavior of more complex situations through a normal situation. If you are studying individuals who are suffering from illness and the stochastic variable is linked to the illness, the normal situation almost never applies.</p>
<h4>Distribution Shorthand</h4>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the normal situation we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Normal Distribution with expected value `mu` and variance `sigma^2`.  We denote this with the expression `X &#8275;N(mu,sigma^2)`.</p>
<h4>Distribution Function Notation</h4>
<p>Let the parameter `mu` represent the expected value of the stochastic variable (assume that we know this value and assume that `-oo leq mu leq +oo`) and the parameter `sigma^2` represent the variance of the stochastic variable (also assume that we know this value and that `0 &lt; sigma^2`). We will further assume that the stochastic variable is unbounded. That is to say that we will assume that $note2 the stochastic variable can take on any value; `-oo &lt; x &lt; +oo`. The distribution function (cumlative probability function; CPF) for normal (Gaussian) distributions is given by</p>
`C_{N}(x|mu,sigma^2)=int_(-oo)^x1/(root[2]{2 pi sigma^2})exp(-frac{(x-mu)^2}{2sigma^2})dt`
<p>Don't worry about getting bogged down with mathematical notation.  Keep in mind what a distribution function tells us: the accumulated probability for all values of the stochastic variable less than or equal to x. </p>
<h4>Probability Notation</h4>
<p>If you want to use Probability Notation for Normally (Gaussian) distributed stochastic variables, we will write:</p>
`P[X le x|X &#8275;N(mu,sigma^2)]`
<p>Note: we can use any of the six events in place of `X le x`.</p>
<h4>Example Situation</h4>
<p>In a certain population of the herring <em>Pomolobus aestivalis</em>, the lengths (in mm) of individual fish form a symmetric, bell-shaped frequency histogram.</p>

  <li>Define the stochastic variable in this situation.</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>Describe a stochastic process that could be used in this situation. Be sure to include any assumptions that might need to make.</li>

  <li>Consider the following expression: `C_N(45|54,20.25)`. Fill in the following blanks with the appropriate values to complete the interpretation of this expression:</li>
  The probability of selecting a herring that is at most [AB2] mms is [AB3] given we assume that the herring lengths follow a [AB4] distribution with an expected value of [AB5] and a variance of [AB6]. $note3
  <li>Express (using Function Notation) the probability that a selected herring whose length is 62mm or more extreme? [AB7]</li>

<h2>Log-normal Distributions</h2>
<p>There are two main situations where log-normal distributions describe the behaivor of the stochastic variable: skewed distributions (in particular, when you're talking about <em>amounts</em> and situations where we can only meaningfully combine values through multiplication but not addition (think rates, speeds, percentages). The values of these stochastic variables are always positive (zero and negative values are not allowed).</p>
<p>When we anticipate (and observe) either a few extremely large values or a few extremely small values (but <strong>not both</strong>; typically large values), we will have a skewed histogram. If you think back to the third moment of a distribution, you are looking for a number away from zero. When you look at the histogram, you'll see one modal clump and then there will be a "tail" of values extending out for a quite a ways in one direction or the other. For a box-and-whisker plot, one whisker will be visually much longer than than the other.</p>
<h4>Distribution Shorthand</h4>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the Log-normal situation we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Log-normal Distribution with location `mu` and shape `sigma`.  We denote this with the expression `X &#8275;LOGN(mu,sigma)`.</p>
<h4>Distribution Function Notation</h4>
<p>The distribution function (cumlative probability function; CPF) for log-normal distributions is given by</p>
`C_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=int_(0)^x1/(x sigma root[2]{2 pi})exp(-frac{(log(x)-mu)^2}{2(sigma)^2})dt`
<h4>Probability Notation</h4>
<p>If you want to use Probability Notation for a log-normal distributed stochastic variables, we will write:</p>

<h2>Log-normal Distributions</h2>
<p>There are two main situations where log-normal distributions describe the behaivor of the stochastic variable: skewed distributions (in particular, when you're talking about <em>amounts</em> and situations where we can only meaningfully combine values through multiplication but not addition (think rates, speeds, percentages). The values of these stochastic variables are always positive (zero and negative values are not allowed).</p>
<p>When we anticipate (and observe) either a few extremely large values or a few extremely small values (but <strong>not both</strong>; typically large values), we will have a skewed histogram. If you think back to the third moment of a distribution, you are looking for a number away from zero. When you look at the histogram, you'll see one modal clump and then there will be a "tail" of values extending out for a quite a ways in one direction or the other. For a box-and-whisker plot, one whisker will be visually much longer than than the other.</p>
<h4>Distribution Shorthand</h4>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the Log-normal situation we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Log-normal Distribution with location `mu` and shape `sigma`.  We denote this with the expression `X &#8275;LOGN(mu,sigma)`.</p>
<h4>Distribution Function Notation</h4>
<p>The distribution function (cumlative probability function; CPF) for log-normal distributions is given by</p>
`C_{LN}(x|mu,sigma)=int_(0)^x1/(x sigma root[2]{2 pi})exp(-frac{(log(x)-mu)^2}{2(sigma)^2})dt`
<h4>Probability Notation</h4>
<p>If you want to use Probability Notation for a log-normal distributed stochastic variables, we will write:</p>
`P[X le x|X &#8275;LOGN(mu,sigma)]`
<p>Don't worry about getting bogged down with mathematical notation.  Keep in mind what a distribution function tells us: the accumulated probability for all values of the stochastic variable less than or equal to x. </p>
<p>Note: we can use any of the six events in place of `X le x`.</p>
<h4>Example Situation</h4>
<p>The size of ice crystals has a direct impact on the texture of the ice cream.  The larger the crystals, the courser texture that the ice cream has.  In gallon containers of Brand Icey vanilla ice cream, food scientists believe that diameter (&mu;m) of the ice crystals are the best way to measure the size of ice crystals.</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>What assumptions would the food scientists need to make in order to declare that the diameter follows a log-normal distribution?</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>The food scientists examined 2000 samples of the ice cream and constructed the data visualizations below.</li>

<h2>Discrete Uniform Distributions</h2>
<p>You are already familiar with situations that involve stochastic variables that follow discrete uniform distributions. From flipping coins, to rolling dice, to running lotteries, and spinning spiners, you've worked with the stochastic processes that underpin these discrete uniform distributions since childhood. There are two assumptions that we make in these situations: </p>
<ol type=1>
  <li>that we have a known and fixed number of outcomes possible (e.g., Heads or Tails; the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; the integers 1-69 on white balls and the integers 1-26 on red balls for the Powerball lottery)</li>
  <li>that the process is "fair", each outcome has the same long-run relative frequency of occurring (in other words, we're dealing with chance).
</ol>
<h4>Distribution Shorthand</h4>
<p>When a stochastic variable and the associated stochastic process are consistent with the discrete uniform situation, we state that the stochastic variable follows (or has) a Discrete Uniform Distribution with `N` possible outcomes. We denote this with the expression `X &#8275;DU(N)`.</p>
<h4>Distribution Function Notation</h4>
<p>Recall that for continuous stochastic variables, the accumulation of outcomes happens in a smooth and continuous way. This is not the case for discrete stochastic variables. Rather, the accumulation occurs in bursts. This is what enables us to be able to say that for some values of the stochastic variable that the probability of being an exact value is not always zero; that is to say that `P[X=x|text{assumptions}]geq0`. $note0 </p>
<p>The probability at any particular value is `1/N`, for stochastic varibles that have Discrete Uniform distributions. The distribution function is still the accumulation of stochastic process outcomes and the interpretation is the same. However, instead of using the integral from calculus, we use the discrete analog: summation. </p>
`C_{DU}(x|N)=sum_{j=1}^x(1/N times Delta x)`
<p>Notice that the summation begins at 1 and we let `j` index the possible outcomes rather than using the actual values of the stochastic variable. This indexing gives us some flexibility to account for more situations (e.g., flipping coins). About the only time that you will make use of discrete uniform situations is in the selection of participants; these situations are not common in outside of board games and some forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Don't worry about getting bogged down with mathematical notation.  Keep in mind what a distribution function tells us: the accumulated probability for all values of the stochastic variable less than or equal to x. </p>
<h4>Probability Notation</h4>
<p>If you want to use Probability Notation for Normally (Gaussian) distributed stochastic variables, we will write:</p>
`P[X le x|X &#8275;DU(N)]`
<p>Note: we can use any of the six events in place of `X le x`.</p>
<h4>Example Situation</h4>
<p>Suppose that you have been given an icosahedron (20-sided) die that is fair to roll. What is the probability that you roll a number that is strictly less than 7?</p>
<ol type=A>
  <li>What is the stochastic variable in this situation?</li>
  [AB0]
  <li>Describe a stochastic process that could be used in this situation. Be sure to include any assumptions that might need to make.</li>
  [AB1]
  <li>Express (using Function Notation) the probability of rolling a number strictly less than 7. [AB2] $note1 $previewloc[2]</li>
  <li>Give the numeric value of the expression you just wrote. [AB3]</li>
